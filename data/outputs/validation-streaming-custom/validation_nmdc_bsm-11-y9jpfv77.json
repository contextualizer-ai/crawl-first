    "CRITICAL: Major coordinate mismatch - 716km distance between asserted coordinates (61.9333, -162.8666) and geocoded location (64.4459613, -149.680909) from geo_loc_name",
    "MAJOR: Ecosystem alignment conflict - asserted freshwater river environment vs inferred savanna/sparse forest land cover types",
    "MODERATE: No water features detected within 1000m of asserted coordinates despite claiming river surface water sample",
    "MODERATE: Weather station used for inference is 139km away, reducing reliability of environmental context",
    "MINOR: Sample collection site 'river surface water' is descriptive but could be more specific",
    "MINOR: Gleysol soil type (wetland soil) partially supports aquatic environment but conflicts with savanna land cover"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinates - either update lat_lon field to match Yukon River location or clarify geo_loc_name to match actual sampling coordinates",
    "Cross-reference with field notes or GPS data from original sampling to determine correct coordinates",
    "If coordinates are correct, investigate why land cover shows savanna instead of aquatic environment - may indicate seasonal variation or data resolution issues",
    "Add more specific location details to geo_loc_name field following NMDC schema format: 'country: region, specific location'",
    "Consider adding elevation data to support coordinate validation",
    "Validate sample collection methodology description against study protocol to ensure consistency",
    "Review other Yukon River samples in the study for coordinate consistency patterns"
