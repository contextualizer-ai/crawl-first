  "issues": [
    "Land cover data shows dominant terrestrial vegetation (deciduous broadleaf trees, woody savannas) which conflicts with lake water sampling location",
    "QA land cover classification identifies location as 'Classified water' but other classification systems show terrestrial vegetation",
    "Inferred land cover suggests savanna/forest environment which is inconsistent with freshwater lake ecosystem",
    "Collection date (July 7, 2016) shows summer sampling but no seasonal context validation possible",
    "Multiple conflicting land cover classifications reduce confidence in environmental context"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify that coordinates (46.008, -89.701) accurately represent the lake water sampling location rather than nearby terrestrial areas",
    "Cross-reference land cover data sources to resolve conflicting classifications between 'Classified water' and terrestrial vegetation systems",
    "Consider updating coordinates to be more precisely located over the water body if sampling was conducted from the lake center",
    "Add elevation context relative to lake surface for depth measurements",
    "Include seasonal context information to support July collection timing",
    "Validate that the 4-meter depth measurement is appropriate for the specific lake location"
