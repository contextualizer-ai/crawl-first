    "CRITICAL: Major coordinate discrepancy - 149.79 km difference between asserted coordinates (43.0995, -89.4045) and geocoded location (44.4308975, -89.6884637)",
    "Asserted coordinates place sample in Madison area (Dane County) while geo_loc_name suggests broader Wisconsin state",
    "Inferred soil type (Luvisols) not typical for aquatic lake water samples - indicates potential georeferencing issue",
    "Weather data sourced from distant station (31.7 km away) reduces confidence in environmental context",
    "Sample collection site 'lake surface water' lacks specificity for depth or exact sampling location within the lake"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - check if coordinates (43.0995, -89.4045) actually correspond to Lake Mendota sampling location",
    "Cross-reference coordinates with study documentation and other Lake Mendota samples to ensure consistency",
    "Consider updating geo_loc_name to be more specific (e.g., 'USA: Wisconsin, Lake Mendota, Madison') to better match coordinates",
    "Add sampling depth information to sample_collection_site field for better context",
    "Validate coordinates against known Lake Mendota location (approximately 43.1\u00b0N, 89.4\u00b0W)",
    "Review other samples from this study to check for similar coordinate inconsistencies"
