    "Coordinate discrepancy: 4.53km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location for 'USA: Michigan, Lake City'",
    "Major semantic conflict: env_broad_scale claims 'temperate woodland biome' but sample is from agricultural switchgrass field with fertilization",
    "Environmental hierarchy mismatch: woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil creates logical inconsistency",
    "Land cover conflict: Inferred land cover shows forest/woodland systems (deciduous broadleaf, savannas) conflicting with asserted agricultural ecosystem",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 129m difference between asserted (500m) and geospatial lookup (371m)",
    "Ecosystem classification inconsistency: Claims 'temperate woodland biome' but describes fertilized switchgrass agricultural system",
    "Soil type mismatch: Inferred podzol soil type doesn't align well with typical agricultural farm soil expectations"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - either use geocoded coordinates (44.335287, -85.215046) for Lake City center or update geo_loc_name to reflect actual sampling location",
    "Correct env_broad_scale to agricultural biome or cropland biome (e.g., ENVO:01000245 'anthropogenic terrestrial biome') to match the fertilized switchgrass agricultural context",
    "Update environmental hierarchy for consistency: agricultural biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil makes logical sense",
    "Verify elevation measurement - confirm if 500m is correct for this location or use geospatial-derived 371m",
    "Consider adding more specific location details to geo_loc_name if coordinates represent a specific field rather than Lake City center",
    "Validate soil classification - confirm if podzol is appropriate for this agricultural setting or if different soil characterization is needed",
    "Review study methodology to ensure environmental classification aligns with actual sampling from fertilized agricultural switchgrass plots"
