    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 20.6 km between asserted coordinates (47.128415, -99.239356) and geocoded location from Chase Lake National Wildlife Refuge",
    "Asserted ecosystem_subtype and specific_ecosystem are both 'Unclassified' which provides minimal environmental context",
    "Collection date July 18, 2022 is during peak growing season which may not be optimal for grassland soil studies",
    "geo_loc_name format partially compliant with NMDC schema but could be more specific",
    "Current vegetation description contains species codes that may need verification"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - either update to actual Chase Lake NWR coordinates (47.007, -99.446) or clarify if sampling was done at a different location",
    "Update ecosystem_subtype and specific_ecosystem with more descriptive classifications (e.g., 'Prairie grassland' or 'Temperate grassland')",
    "Verify species codes in cur_vegetation field: RACO3, NAVI4, MESA, BOCU, POPR",
    "Consider adding more specific location details to geo_loc_name for better geographic precision",
    "Add metadata about seasonal considerations for soil sampling timing",
    "Consider enriching with soil classification information beyond the basic 'soil' designation"
