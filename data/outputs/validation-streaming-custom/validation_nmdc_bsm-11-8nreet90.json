    "Geographic coordinate mismatch: 2.85 km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location for Berkeley, CA",
    "Major ecosystem conflict: Asserted 'Host-associated/Plants/Rhizosphere' environment conflicts with inferred 'Urban biome' land cover classification",
    "Soil type inconsistency: Phaeozem soil type (forest/grassland) incompatible with urban industrial location",
    "Location inconsistency: Coordinates point to industrial area near warehouses/factories, not typical plant growth environment",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 6m difference between asserted (13.0m) and geospatial (7.0m) elevation",
    "Environmental context mismatch: OSM features show industrial/warehouse area inconsistent with rhizosphere research setting",
    "Study design inconsistency: Other Berkeley samples in study show same coordinate/ecosystem conflicts suggesting systematic location error"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct geographic coordinates - current coordinates (37.851667, -122.294444) appear to point to wrong location",
    "Confirm actual sampling location - was this really an industrial warehouse area or a controlled growth chamber/greenhouse?",
    "Update geo_loc_name to be more specific about actual sampling facility (e.g., 'USA: California, Berkeley, LBNL growth chamber')",
    "Reconcile ecosystem classification with actual sampling environment - if from growth chamber, consider updating ecosystem fields",
    "Cross-reference with other Berkeley samples in study to ensure coordinate consistency",
    "Add facility-specific location details to distinguish controlled environment from field sampling",
    "Consider adding env_package value specific to controlled environment if applicable",
    "Verify elevation measurement or use geospatial lookup value (7.0m) if more accurate"
