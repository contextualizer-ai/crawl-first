    "Coordinate discrepancy: 5.25 km difference between asserted coordinates (35.965252, -84.286859) and geocoded location from geo_loc_name (36.0103562, -84.2696449)",
    "Elevation inconsistency: 18m difference between asserted elevation (316m) and geospatial lookup (334m)",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields - 60% of other study samples have these populated",
    "Land cover shows deciduous broadleaf forest but OSM data indicates significant industrial land use nearby (Environmental Management Waste Management Facility)",
    "Collection location appears to be near industrial/landfill areas which may affect soil sample interpretation"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and reconcile coordinate accuracy - investigate which coordinate pair is correct for the actual sampling location",
    "Cross-reference elevation measurement with field collection protocols to determine source of discrepancy",

    "Review sampling protocol to ensure soil samples from this location are representative of intended ecosystem type given proximity to industrial areas",
    "Consider adding environmental context notes about nearby industrial facilities that may influence soil chemistry",
    "Validate that Bear Creek Road location aligns with NEON sampling design for Oak Ridge site"
