    "Major coordinate mismatch: 149.79 km distance between asserted coords (43.0995, -89.4045) and geocoded location for Wisconsin (44.4308975, -89.6884637)",
    "Coordinates point to Madison area but description specifies Lake Mendota specifically - need lake-specific coordinates",
    "Luvisol soil type from coordinate lookup is not typical for lake environments - indicates coordinate accuracy issues",
    "Sample name suggests Lake Mendota but coordinates are generic Madison location",

    "Verify and correct coordinates to Lake Mendota-specific location (should be approximately 43.1056, -89.4053 for Lake Mendota)",
