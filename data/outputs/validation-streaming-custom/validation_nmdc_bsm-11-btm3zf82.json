  "issues": [
    "env_local_scale and env_broad_scale use identical ENVO term (ENVO:01001442) - phyllosphere should not equal agricultural biome",
    "Severe semantic conflict: asserted 'agricultural biome' vs inferred 'savanna/woodland' land cover",
    "env_triad hierarchy broken: agricultural biome \u2192 phyllosphere biome \u2192 plant-associated biome lacks logical progression",
    "Land cover shows 30-60% tree cover (woody savannas/open forests) inconsistent with typical agricultural fields",
    "Schema violation: geo_loc_name format should follow 'country: region, specific location' pattern",
    "Host plant (switchgrass) and agricultural context conflicts with inferred woodland/savanna environment"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Fix env_local_scale to use correct phyllosphere term (ENVO:00002121 'phyllosphere' not ENVO:01001442)",
    "Verify coordinates and land cover classification - agricultural vs woodland discrepancy needs resolution",
    "Correct geo_loc_name format to 'USA: Michigan, Kellogg Biological Station' following NMDC schema",
    "Reconsider env_broad_scale if sample truly from woodland/savanna rather than agricultural field",
    "Add more specific location context to resolve agricultural vs natural vegetation conflict",
    "Cross-reference with study methodology to confirm sampling environment classification",
    "Consider using more specific agricultural ecosystem terms if confirmed as farmland sample"
