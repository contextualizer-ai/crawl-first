    "Major semantic conflict: env_medium 'epixylon' (wood surface) contradicts freshwater river biome and riffle environment",
    "Environmental hierarchy mismatch: riffle (rocky stream bed) incompatible with epixylon (wood substrate)",
    "Land cover shows deciduous broadleaf forest but sample is from aquatic riffle environment",
    "Coordinate discrepancy: 0.6km difference between asserted coords and geocoded location",
    "Elevation difference: 12.3m between asserted (76.7m) and geospatial (89.0m)",
    "Env_package 'water' doesn't align with epixylon substrate sampling",
    "Sample name suggests epixylon but environmental context indicates aquatic riffle"

  "recommendations": [
    "CRITICAL: Verify env_medium - should be aquatic substrate (e.g., ENVO:00002007 'sediment') not epixylon for riffle sampling",
    "Review sampling methodology - clarify if sampling wood surfaces in stream or stream bed substrate",
    "Validate coordinates against Mayfield Creek location - consider using geocoded coordinates (32.9550101, -87.4082325)",
    "Update elevation to geospatially-derived value (89.0m) for better accuracy",
    "Ensure env_medium matches the actual substrate being sampled in the riffle environment",
    "Consider env_medium alternatives: streambed sediment, benthic material, or aquatic substrate",
    "Verify sample collection protocol aligns with metadata - riffle sampling typically targets sediment/biofilm, not wood"
