    "CRITICAL: Massive coordinate discrepancy - asserted coords (88.077, 27.260) place sample in Central Arctic Ocean, but geocoded coords (22.285, 114.155) place it in Hong Kong, China - 7,519 km difference",
    "CRITICAL: Geocoding error - location 'Central Arctic Ocean' incorrectly resolved to Hong Kong fast food restaurant",
    "Schema violation: geo_loc_name format 'Central Arctic Ocean' does not follow INSDC/GAZ standard format 'country/sea: region, specific location'",
    "Temperature (-1.81\u00b0C) is inconsistent with Hong Kong location but consistent with Arctic Ocean",
    "Chemical parameters (nutrients, conductivity) are consistent with Arctic marine environment, not Hong Kong waters",
    "Study context indicates Arctic Ocean sampling but coordinates suggest tropical/subtropical location",
    "Depth of 51m is plausible for both locations but environmental chemistry strongly suggests Arctic origin"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinate data - coordinates appear to be incorrectly transcribed or swapped",
    "Update geo_loc_name to proper INSDC format: 'Arctic Ocean: Central Arctic Ocean, [specific site name if available]'",
    "Cross-reference with original field notes/GPS logs to confirm correct sampling coordinates",
    "Validate all coordinates in this study dataset for similar transcription errors",
    "Consider adding elevation data for marine samples (should be ~0m for sea surface)",
    "Add quality control checks for coordinate-location name consistency in data pipeline",
    "Implement geocoding validation that flags large discrepancies between asserted and resolved coordinates",
    "Review other samples in study nmdc:sty-11-h1m9nj62 for similar coordinate errors"
