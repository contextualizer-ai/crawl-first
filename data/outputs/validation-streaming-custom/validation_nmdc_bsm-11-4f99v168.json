    "Coordinates mismatch: 4.44 km difference between asserted coords and geocoded location",
    "Major elevation discrepancy: 206m difference between asserted (500m) and geospatial lookup (294m)",
    "Severe ecosystem type conflict: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' vs inferred land cover showing 'woody savannas/open forests'",
    "Agricultural field contradiction: Asserted agricultural field but inferred land cover shows deciduous woodland/savanna ecosystem",
    "Land use inconsistency: Sample claims agricultural field with switchgrass but land cover data indicates natural woodland ecosystem",
    "Environmental context mismatch: Farm soil designation conflicts with woodland/savanna land cover classifications",
    "Study design inconsistency: Other samples in same study from same location may have similar coordinate issues"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - geocoded location for Delton, MI suggests coordinates should be closer to 42.4998, -85.4081",
    "Validate elevation measurement - 500m appears too high for this region of Michigan (should be ~290m)",
    "Reassess env_broad_scale classification - land cover data suggests woodland/savanna rather than agricultural biome",
    "Clarify land use history - determine if site was converted from natural woodland to agricultural use",
    "Review ecosystem classification hierarchy - current classification may not accurately reflect actual site conditions",
    "Cross-validate with other study samples - check if similar coordinate/elevation issues exist in related samples",
    "Consider updating env_broad_scale to better reflect mixed woodland-agricultural landscape",
    "Add temporal context - specify when agricultural conversion occurred if applicable"
