    "Major ecosystem conflict: asserted 'pastureland/hayfields' environment vs inferred 'deciduous broadleaf forest' land cover",
    "Soil type mismatch: env_local_scale indicates agricultural land but soil classification is Acriosols (tropical weathered soils)",
    "Inconsistent environmental context: pastureland assertion conflicts with dense forest land cover data",
    "Potential coordinate error: asserted location appears to be in forested area rather than agricultural pasture",
    "Missing ecosystem_subtype specification (marked as 'Unclassified')",
    "No soil ontology matches found for inferred Acriosols soil type"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - investigate 7.48km discrepancy between asserted coords and Oak Ridge geocoded location",
    "Re-examine env_local_scale classification - confirm if sampling site is actually pastureland/hayfields or if coordinates point to forested area",
    "Cross-reference with field notes to determine correct environmental context (agricultural vs forest)",
    "Consider updating coordinates if sample was actually collected in deciduous forest environment",
    "Add proper ecosystem_subtype classification to replace 'Unclassified'",
    "Validate soil type classification - Acriosols may not be appropriate for Tennessee temperate climate",
    "Review sampling protocol documentation to ensure environmental descriptors match actual collection site",
    "Consider adding land cover validation step to NEON sampling workflow"
