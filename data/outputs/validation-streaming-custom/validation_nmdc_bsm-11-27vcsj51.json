    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 4.44 km difference between asserted coords and geocoded location",
    "Major elevation inconsistency: 206m difference (asserted 500m vs geospatial 294m)",
    "Environmental type conflict: Agricultural field (asserted) vs Savanna/Deciduous Forest (inferred land cover)",
    "Ecosystem hierarchy mismatch: temperate woodland biome claimed but coordinates indicate savanna/sparse forest",
    "Land cover data suggests natural woodland/savanna, contradicts agricultural field designation",
    "Soil type (Luvisols) not typical for actively managed agricultural fields",
    "Switchgrass cultivation location questionable given land cover classification"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct GPS coordinates - current coordinates may be incorrect for the intended agricultural field location",
    "Re-examine elevation measurement - 206m discrepancy suggests potential coordinate error",
    "Clarify land use classification - determine if site is truly an agricultural field or natural/semi-natural area",
    "Consider updating env_broad_scale to match actual land cover (savanna biome rather than woodland)",
    "Validate sample collection location against study protocol - ensure sample was collected from intended agricultural field",
    "Cross-reference with field notes and photos to confirm agricultural vs natural land use",
    "Consider using geocoded coordinates (42.4997581, -85.4080641) which align better with Delton, Michigan location"
