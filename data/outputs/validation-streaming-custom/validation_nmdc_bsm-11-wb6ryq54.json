    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 9.74 km difference between asserted coordinates (45.763274, -87.187681) and geocoded location from Escanaba, MI (45.7455707, -87.0647434)",
    "Large elevation difference: 285m between asserted elevation (500m) and geospatially inferred elevation (215m)",
    "Semantic conflict: env_broad_scale 'temperate woodland biome' conflicts with inferred land cover dominated by 'grassland area' and 'herbaceous annuals'",
    "Ecosystem inconsistency: ecosystem_subtype 'Agricultural land' matches inferred grassland/herbaceous systems, but env_broad_scale suggests woodland",
    "Environmental contradiction: cur_vegetation 'Undisturbed Control' and experimental_factor_other 'Undisturbed Control' conflict with env_local_scale 'agricultural field' and agrochem_addition 'Fertilized'",
    "Treatment designation unclear: sample marked as both 'Undisturbed Control' and 'Fertilized', creating logical contradiction"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - the 9.74 km discrepancy suggests potential data entry error or wrong coordinate system",
    "Re-examine elevation data - 285m difference indicates possible coordinate or elevation recording error",
    "Reconcile env_broad_scale with land cover data - consider changing from 'temperate woodland biome' to 'grassland biome' or 'agricultural biome' to match inferred grassland systems",
    "Clarify treatment designation - resolve contradiction between 'Undisturbed Control' and 'Fertilized' status",
    "Review env_broad_scale selection - ensure it accurately reflects the agricultural/grassland context rather than woodland",
    "Validate sample classification within study design - confirm if this sample represents control or treatment condition",
    "Consider updating cur_vegetation to reflect actual agricultural/grassland context rather than generic 'Undisturbed Control'",
    "Cross-reference with other study samples to ensure consistent environmental terminology and treatment labeling"
