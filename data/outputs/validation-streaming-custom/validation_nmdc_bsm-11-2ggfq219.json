    "Minor inconsistency: env_medium is 'organic material' while sample is from coral tissue/reef environment - expected 'seawater' or 'coral tissue'",
    "geo_loc_name format could be more specific: 'Panama: Gulf of Panama, Saboga' lacks specific location details for a coral reef site",
    "Land cover classification shows 'Water Bodies' but sample is specifically from coral reef habitat - may reflect spatial resolution limitations"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Consider updating env_medium to ENVO:00002149 (seawater) or ENVO:02000047 (coral tissue) for better semantic accuracy",
    "Enhance geo_loc_name with more specific reef location details, e.g., 'Panama: Gulf of Panama, Saboga Island, coral reef site'",
    "Add depth measurement context - 3.8m depth is consistent with coral reef sampling but could specify if this is water depth or substrate depth",
    "Consider adding more specific habitat descriptors for the coral reef microenvironment",
    "Validate that 'organic material' env_medium is intentional for this coral microbiome study design"
