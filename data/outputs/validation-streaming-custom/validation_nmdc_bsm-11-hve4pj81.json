    "Coordinate mismatch: 10.52 km difference between asserted coordinates (42.013, -93.743) and geocoded location from 'USA: Iowa, Ames' (42.0267567, -93.6170448)",
    "Administrative inconsistency: Asserted coordinates place sample in Boone County, but geocoded Ames location is in Story County",
    "Minor elevation discrepancy: 39m difference between asserted elevation (325m) and geocoded elevation (286m) from location name",
    "Limited environmental features detected at asserted coordinates - only cemetery and fence within 1000m radius",
    "Study design note: Sample appears to be from controlled agricultural field experiment but coordinates may not precisely locate the specific experimental plot"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - use GPS coordinates from actual sampling location rather than general area coordinates",
    "Clarify administrative location - confirm whether sample is from Boone County (asserted coords) or Story County (Ames city limits)",
    "Consider using more precise field/plot-level coordinates for agricultural research sites",
    "Add experimental plot identifier or field station details to improve spatial precision",
    "Cross-reference coordinates with other samples from same study to ensure spatial consistency within the experimental design",
    "Update geo_loc_name to be more specific (e.g., 'USA: Iowa, Boone County' if asserted coordinates are correct)"
