    "Geographic coordinate mismatch: 19.16 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.06, -71.37761) and geocoded location (42.1538607, -71.1828015)",
    "Major ecosystem conflict: Asserted lake sediment sample vs inferred deciduous broadleaf forest land cover at coordinates",
    "Environmental context contradiction: Sample claims aquatic/lake environment but coordinates point to terrestrial forest area",
    "Land cover inconsistency: All land cover systems (IGBP, LCCS, UMD) indicate deciduous broadleaf forest, not aquatic environment",
    "Elevation discrepancy: Asserted depth 0.42m vs inferred elevation 110m above sea level at coordinates",
    "Location precision issue: Coordinates appear to be in Franklin, MA rather than a lake in Norfolk County",
    "Soil type mismatch: Podzol soil type typical of forested areas, inconsistent with lake sediment sample"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - current coordinates (42.06, -71.37761) appear to point to a terrestrial forest location rather than a lake",
    "If coordinates are correct, reassess sample type and ecosystem classification - appears to be terrestrial forest sample, not lake sediment",
    "If sample is truly lake sediment, provide coordinates that point to an actual water body in Norfolk County, MA",
    "Cross-reference with original field notes and GPS data to resolve coordinate accuracy",
    "Consider using more precise geocoding for Norfolk County lakes to identify correct sampling location",
    "Update depth measurement to reflect actual sampling depth in lake water column if aquatic sample",
    "Validate ecosystem fields against actual sampling environment - current classification conflicts with coordinate-based inference",
    "Review sample collection methodology described in EMP protocols to ensure consistent metadata reporting"
