    "Major semantic conflict: env_local_scale claims 'evergreen forest' but all land cover data indicates grassland ecosystem",
    "Coordinate displacement: 4.49 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from 'USA: Utah, Onaqui'",
    "Environmental hierarchy inconsistency: terrestrial biome \u2192 evergreen forest \u2192 soil does not align with grassland land cover",
    "Missing ecosystem_subtype value (currently 'Unclassified') despite rich environmental context available",
    "Land cover data shows consistent grassland classification across multiple systems but conflicts with asserted forest environment",
    "Collection date (2016-07-28) in summer aligns well with temperature (29\u00b0C) and dry conditions (4.8% water content)",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 10m difference between asserted (1886m) and geospatial lookup (1896m) is acceptable"

  "recommendations": [
    "CRITICAL: Verify and correct env_local_scale - change from 'evergreen forest' to grassland-appropriate term like ENVO:00000106 (grassland area)",
    "Review coordinate accuracy - consider using geocoded coordinates (40.2106006, -112.5610339) if more representative of actual sampling location",
    "Update ecosystem_subtype from 'Unclassified' to more specific term like 'Grassland' or 'Semi-arid grassland'",
    "Cross-reference sampling protocols to confirm environmental context - was sample actually from forest edge transitioning to grassland?",
    "Consider adding land_use or habitat_description field to capture the grassland nature of the sampling site",
    "Validate env_local_scale against field notes or site photos to resolve forest vs grassland discrepancy",
    "Use regosol soil type information from enrichment to enhance soil characterization fields"
