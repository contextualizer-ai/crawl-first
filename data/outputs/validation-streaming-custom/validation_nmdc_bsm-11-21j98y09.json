    "Coordinate discrepancy: 5.36 km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location name",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields (common in other study samples)",
    "Soil type (Podzols) has moderate consistency with wetland environment but could be better aligned",
    "Collection date format includes seconds precision which may be excessive for soil sampling",
    "Some inferred land cover classifications show mixed savanna/forest types indicating transitional ecosystem"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and reconcile coordinate discrepancy - determine if asserted coordinates or location name is more accurate",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with study design",
    "Consider adding soil classification details that better reflect wetland characteristics",
    "Standardize collection date format to appropriate precision for sampling method",
    "Add environmental context notes about transitional savanna-wetland ecosystem characteristics",
    "Validate soil horizon designation 'M horizon' as this is non-standard terminology",
    "Consider adding water table depth measurements given wetland context"
