    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 149.79 km distance between asserted coordinates (43.0995, -89.4045) and geocoded location from geo_loc_name (44.4308975, -89.6884637)",
    "Low land cover-soil consistency: Aquatic sample shows 'Luvisols' soil type which is terrestrial, inconsistent with lake water environment",
    "Asserted coordinates point to Lake Mendota specifically, but geo_loc_name 'USA: Wisconsin' is too broad and geocodes to state center",
    "Environmental features lookup found no water features within 1000m of asserted coordinates, raising questions about coordinate accuracy",
    "Soil type classification inappropriate for aquatic sample - should be sediment classification instead"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - asserted coordinates (43.0995, -89.4045) appear to be correct for Lake Mendota, but geo_loc_name should be more specific",
    "Update geo_loc_name to 'USA: Wisconsin, Lake Mendota' or 'USA: Wisconsin, Madison' to better match coordinates",
    "Replace soil type classification with lake sediment or bottom substrate classification appropriate for aquatic environments",
    "Consider adding water body identifier or lake-specific metadata fields",
    "Validate coordinate precision against known Lake Mendota boundaries",
    "Review environmental feature detection methodology for aquatic sampling sites"
