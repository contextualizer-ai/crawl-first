    "Semantic conflict: asserted 'area of evergreen forest' but inferred land cover shows 'Deciduous Broadleaf Forests' consistently across all systems",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 16.4m difference between asserted (184.6m) and geospatial lookup (201.0m)",
    "Environmental triad inconsistency: 'area of evergreen forest' (local scale) conflicts with deciduous broadleaf forest land cover",
    "geo_loc_name format deviation: uses '&' instead of standard comma separation for multiple locations",
    "Missing ecosystem fields in some study samples suggests inconsistent data collection"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct env_local_scale term - should be 'area of deciduous forest' or similar to match deciduous broadleaf forest land cover",
    "Validate elevation measurement or update with geospatially-derived value (201.0m)",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name format to 'USA: Massachusetts, Harvard Forest, Quabbin Watershed' for consistency",
    "Review field collection protocols to ensure accurate forest type identification",
    "Cross-validate env_local_scale terms with actual vegetation surveys or remote sensing data",
    "Consider adding vegetation survey metadata to support environmental ontology term selection"
