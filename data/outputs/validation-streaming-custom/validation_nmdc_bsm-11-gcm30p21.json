    "CRITICAL: Massive coordinate discrepancy - asserted coords (86.18\u00b0N, 15.52\u00b0E) in Arctic vs geocoded coords (22.29\u00b0N, 114.15\u00b0E) in Hong Kong, distance: 7,599 km",
    "Geographic inconsistency: Asserted coords place sample in Arctic Ocean but geocoded location shows Hong Kong",
    "Environmental mismatch: Geocoded location shows 'Des Voeux Road Central' which is urban Hong Kong, not Arctic Ocean",
    "Ecosystem inconsistency: Sea ice ecosystem claimed but geocoded coordinates show tropical/subtropical location",
    "Temperature anomaly: -12.2\u00b0C claimed for Hong Kong coordinates which would be implausible",
    "Elevation issue: Sea level (0m) from asserted coords vs 24m from geocoded location",
    "Place type error: Geocoded result shows 'fast_food' place type instead of oceanic environment"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinate data - either fix lat_lon field to match Arctic location or update geo_loc_name",
    "Cross-check sample collection records with field notes to determine correct coordinates",
    "Validate all coordinate data for this study as similar issues may affect other samples",
    "Consider using more specific geo_loc_name format following NMDC schema (e.g., 'Arctic Ocean: Central Arctic Ocean, specific ice station')",
    "Add quality control checks for coordinate-location name consistency in data pipeline",
    "Include elevation data in original metadata to improve validation",
    "Review geocoding service configuration to handle polar coordinates correctly"
