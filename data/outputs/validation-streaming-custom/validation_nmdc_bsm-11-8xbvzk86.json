    "Coordinate discrepancy: 10.52 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.013, -93.743) and geocoded location 'USA: Iowa, Ames' (42.0267567, -93.6170448)",
    "Geographic inconsistency: Asserted coordinates place sample in Boone County (Colfax Township) while geo_loc_name indicates Ames (Story County)",
    "Administrative mismatch: Sample appears to be in a different county (Boone vs Story) than the named location suggests",
    "Elevation variation: 39m difference between asserted coordinates elevation (324m) and geocoded Ames elevation (286m)",
    "Limited nearby environmental features: Only cemetery and fence features found within 1km radius, suggesting rural/agricultural setting consistent with farm designation"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - consider re-geocoding the actual sampling location or updating geo_loc_name to reflect Boone County location",
    "Clarify geographic context: If sample is from Ames area research station, ensure coordinates reflect the actual field site location",
    "Consider updating geo_loc_name to be more specific: 'USA: Iowa, Boone County' or include research station/farm name if applicable",
    "Add sampling location metadata: Include facility name or research station identifier if this is from an institutional research farm",
    "Cross-reference with study protocol: Verify coordinates against published methodology for the Miscanthus research sites",
    "Consider adding nearest landmark or research facility identifier to misc_param field for better geographic context"
