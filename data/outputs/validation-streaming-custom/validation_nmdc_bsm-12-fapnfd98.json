    "Coordinate discrepancy: 2.45 km difference between asserted coordinates (35.690428, -83.50379) and geocoded location name coordinates (35.707747, -83.5205215)",
    "Land cover conflict: Asserted 'freshwater river biome' vs inferred 'broadleaf forest' from multiple land cover systems (IGBP, LAI, LCCS1, UMD)",
    "Environmental context mismatch: Sample from aquatic epilithon but coordinates place it in forested terrestrial environment",
    "Minor elevation difference: 9m variance between asserted (579m) and geospatial lookup (570m)",
    "Potential aquatic vs terrestrial habitat confusion affecting sample context interpretation"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - consider using GPS coordinates from actual sampling location rather than general area coordinates",
    "Cross-validate epilithon sampling location with actual stream coordinates - epilithon samples should be from stream bed, not forest canopy",
    "Review field sampling protocols to ensure coordinates are recorded at the precise aquatic sampling point (stream bed) rather than access road or parking area",
    "Consider adding env_medium validation against coordinate-based land cover data to flag potential terrestrial/aquatic mismatches",
    "Update coordinates to reflect actual stream location where epilithon was collected, likely closer to Le Conte Creek waterway",
    "Implement coordinate validation workflow that checks aquatic samples against nearby water features from OSM data"
