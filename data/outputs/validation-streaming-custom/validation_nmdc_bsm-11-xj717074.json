    "Coordinate mismatch: 5.32 km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location name",
    "Environmental semantic conflict: Asserted 'area of deciduous forest' vs inferred 'Mixed Forests' from multiple land cover systems",
    "Missing GOLD ecosystem/ecosystem_category fields that are present in other study samples",
    "County mismatch: Asserted coordinates place sample in Hale County while geocoded location is in Bibb County",
    "Elevation discrepancy: Multiple elevation values (asserted: 83.9m, geospatial lookup: 81.0m, geocoded: 143.0m)",
    "Land cover classification inconsistency across different systems (deciduous vs mixed forest)"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and reconcile coordinate accuracy - recommend using geocoded coordinates (32.9349471, -87.3948069) which better match the stated location",
    "Clarify forest type classification - update env_local_scale to reflect mixed forest characteristics if that better represents the actual sampling site",
    "Add missing ecosystem fields (ecosystem: 'Environmental', ecosystem_category: 'Terrestrial') for consistency with study design",
    "Validate sampling location within Talladega National Forest boundaries and confirm correct county",
    "Consider elevation measurement methodology and select most accurate elevation value",
    "Review and standardize environmental classification to resolve deciduous vs mixed forest discrepancy",
    "Consider adding more specific local environmental descriptors based on the proximity to water features (3 streams within 1000m)"
