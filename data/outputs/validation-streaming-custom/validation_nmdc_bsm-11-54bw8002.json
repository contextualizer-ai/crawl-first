    "Major semantic conflict: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' conflicts with 'agricultural field' and 'farm soil' - woodland biomes are not typically agricultural",
    "Land cover data shows savanna/woodland (30-60% tree cover) conflicts with asserted agricultural field designation",
    "4.4km coordinate discrepancy between asserted coordinates and geocoded location name",
    "Environmental triad incoherent: woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil creates logical inconsistency",
    "Asserted ecosystem fields (Agricultural land, Soil) conflict with woodland biome designation",
    "Current vegetation 'Switchgrass' and fertilizer application support agricultural context but conflict with woodland biome"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Update env_broad_scale from 'temperate woodland biome' to 'agricultural biome' or 'temperate grassland biome' to match agricultural context",
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - 4.4km discrepancy suggests potential data entry error",
    "Consider updating ecosystem fields to be internally consistent - either all agricultural or all woodland",
    "Review land cover classification - savanna designation may indicate mixed agricultural-natural landscape",
    "Validate sample location with field records to resolve coordinate vs. location name discrepancy",
    "Ensure environmental triad follows logical hierarchy: biome \u2192 local environment \u2192 immediate medium"
