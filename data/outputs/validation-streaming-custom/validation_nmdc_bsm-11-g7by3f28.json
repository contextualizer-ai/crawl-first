    "Semantic conflict: Desert ecosystem subtype doesn't align with shrubland land cover classifications",
    "Land cover inconsistency: Multiple systems classify location as shrublands/open shrublands, not desert",
    "Ecosystem classification ambiguity: 'Desert' vs 'area of scrub' environmental descriptions don't align well",

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - consider using geocoded coordinates (31.8334182, -110.8528643) if more accurate",
    "Reassess ecosystem_subtype classification - consider changing from 'Desert' to 'Shrubland' or 'Scrubland' based on land cover data",
    "Review env_local_scale term - 'area of scrub' (ENVO:01000869) better aligns with land cover than desert classification",
    "Update elevation to geospatially-derived value (999.0m) for better accuracy",
    "Add soil type ontology mapping for Yermosols to improve semantic consistency",
    "Consider adding land cover classification terms to metadata for better environmental context"
