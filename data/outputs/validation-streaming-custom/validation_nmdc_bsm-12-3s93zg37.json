    "Significant ecosystem mismatch: Asserted 'freshwater river biome' with 'epipelon' environment conflicts with inferred 'broadleaf forest' land cover across all classification systems",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 19.2m difference between asserted (275.8m) and geospatial lookup (295.0m)",
    "Environmental context conflict: Sample claims to be from stream pool epipelon but coordinates indicate forested terrestrial location",
    "Missing critical ecosystem metadata: ecosystem, ecosystem_category, and ecosystem_type fields are not populated",
    "Potential coordinate error: Forest location inconsistent with aquatic sampling methodology described in study"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinates accuracy - current location (38.89431, -78.147258) appears to be in forested area rather than aquatic environment",
    "Cross-reference with field notes to confirm if sampling occurred in nearby Leach Run (60.8m away) rather than at exact coordinates",
    "Populate missing ecosystem hierarchy fields (ecosystem, ecosystem_category, ecosystem_type) for GOLD compliance",
    "Consider updating coordinates to reflect actual aquatic sampling location if field sampling occurred in stream",
    "Add quality flag noting potential coordinate-environment mismatch for downstream analysis consideration",
    "Review other NEON benthic samples from this site to identify systematic coordinate issues"
