    "Major semantic conflict: env_broad_scale 'temperate woodland biome' contradicts ecosystem_subtype 'Agricultural land' and agricultural context",
    "Coordinate mismatch: 4.44 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from geo_loc_name",
    "Environmental hierarchy inconsistent: woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil creates logical disconnect",
    "Land cover data shows 'Woody Savannas' and 'Deciduous Broadleaf' which conflicts with agricultural field designation",
    "env_broad_scale (woodland biome) does not align with study focus on agricultural switchgrass systems",
    "Current vegetation 'Switchgrass' and fertilization status suggest active agriculture, not woodland"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Update env_broad_scale to agricultural biome or temperate grassland biome to match agricultural context",
    "Verify and correct coordinates - use either asserted coords (42.476365, -85.451887) or geocoded coords (42.4997581, -85.4080641) consistently",
    "Revise environmental hierarchy to: agricultural biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil for logical consistency",
    "Confirm land use classification - if truly agricultural, land cover data may be outdated or misclassified",
    "Consider using 'temperate broadleaf and mixed forest biome' if site is transitioning from forest to agriculture",
    "Add temporal context to clarify if this is converted forest land now used for agriculture"
