    "Soil type 'Acriosols' from soil database may not align perfectly with deciduous forest context",

    "Verify coordinates using high-precision GPS to resolve 340m discrepancy with geocoded location",
    "Cross-check elevation measurement against multiple sources given 4.7m difference",

    "Consider validating soil horizon designation - M horizon is uncommon for deciduous forest surface samples",
    "Add soil texture/classification data to better contextualize Acriosols designation in deciduous forest environment",
