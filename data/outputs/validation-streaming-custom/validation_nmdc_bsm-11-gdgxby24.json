    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 182.53 km between asserted coordinates (32.523355, -87.814626) and geocoded location from 'Dead Lake, Alabama' (30.8887396, -87.9914339)",
    "Environmental hierarchy inconsistency: env_local_scale 'area of woody wetland' conflicts with inferred land cover showing deciduous broadleaf forest (>60% tree cover)",
    "Location context mismatch: asserted coordinates place sample near Demopolis Plant (industrial area) while geo_loc_name indicates Dead Lake (water body)",
    "Semantic conflict: 'area of woody wetland' (wetland) vs 'soil' medium in forest environment - wetland soils have different characteristics",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields that are present in other study samples",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 2.8m difference between asserted (27.2m) and geospatial lookup (30.0m)",
    "Inconsistent environmental context: sample from 'woody wetland' but land cover shows dense deciduous forest"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - use GPS coordinates from actual sampling location or confirm Dead Lake coordinates",
    "Reassess env_local_scale classification: if in forest area, consider 'forest floor' or 'woodland' instead of 'woody wetland'",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with study design",
    "Clarify sampling location: specify if sample was taken from wetland area within broader forest landscape",
    "Review soil horizon classification (M horizon) in context of wetland vs forest environment",
    "Consider adding specific_ecosystem field to clarify wetland vs forest classification",
    "Validate collection coordinates with field notes or GPS logs from sampling date",
    "Update geo_loc_name to be more specific about exact sampling location within Dead Lake area"
