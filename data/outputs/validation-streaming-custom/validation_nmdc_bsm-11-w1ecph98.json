    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields (present in some other study samples)",
    "Minor elevation discrepancy: 12.1m difference between asserted (361.9m) and geospatial (374.0m)",
    "Inconsistent study metadata: some samples have ecosystem fields populated while others don't"

  "recommendations": [
    "Update env_local_scale from 'area of evergreen forest' to 'area of mixed forest' or 'area of deciduous forest' to match inferred land cover data",
    "Populate missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with other study samples",
    "Verify elevation measurement or accept 12.1m geospatial difference as reasonable for forest sampling",
    "Standardize ecosystem field population across all study samples",
    "Consider adding more specific env_local_scale terms that better reflect the mixed forest environment"
