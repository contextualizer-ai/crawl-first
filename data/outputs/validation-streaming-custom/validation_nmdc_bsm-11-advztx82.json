    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 4.44km distance between asserted coordinates (42.476365, -85.451887) and geocoded location name (42.4997581, -85.4080641)",
    "Significant elevation mismatch: 206m difference between asserted (500m) and geospatial lookup (294m)",
    "Critical semantic conflict: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' env_broad_scale contradicts inferred 'agricultural field' local scale and land cover data showing savannas/woody vegetation",
    "Environment hierarchy inconsistency: 'temperate woodland biome' \u2192 'agricultural field' \u2192 'farm soil' lacks logical progression from natural biome to agricultural context",
    "Land cover contradiction: Inferred land cover shows deciduous broadleaf vegetation, savannas, and woody areas (10-60% tree cover) which conflicts with asserted agricultural field context",
    "Ecosystem misalignment: Asserted 'Agricultural land' ecosystem subtype conflicts with inferred natural woodland/savanna environment",
    "Schema format issue: geo_loc_name uses comma separator instead of colon as specified in NMDC schema",
    "Environmental context mismatch: Sample described as fertilized switchgrass agricultural field but inferred data indicates natural woodland/savanna ecosystem"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - either update lat_lon field to match Delton, Michigan geocoded coordinates (42.4997581, -85.4080641) or update geo_loc_name to reflect actual sampling location",
    "Reconcile elevation data - field validate the 500m elevation claim or update to geospatially-consistent 294m elevation",
    "Resolve env_broad_scale conflict - if sampling occurred in an agricultural field within a temperate region, consider using 'temperate grassland biome' [ENVO:01000193] or 'anthropogenic terrestrial biome' [ENVO:01000219] instead of 'temperate woodland biome'",
    "Update environment hierarchy for consistency - ensure env_broad_scale \u2192 env_local_scale \u2192 env_medium follows logical progression (e.g., anthropogenic biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil)",
    "Clarify sampling context - determine if sample was taken from: (1) agricultural switchgrass field, (2) natural grassland/savanna, or (3) agricultural field adjacent to woodland",
    "Fix geo_loc_name format - change 'USA: Michigan, Delton' to 'USA:Michigan:Delton' to comply with NMDC schema requirements",
    "Ground-truth land cover classification - field validate whether location is agricultural or natural ecosystem to resolve semantic conflicts",
    "Consider sample location precision - if sampling occurred at field edge or transitional zone, metadata should reflect this context"
