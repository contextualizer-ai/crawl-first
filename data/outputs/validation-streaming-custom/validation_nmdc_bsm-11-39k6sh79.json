  "issues": [
    "Semantic conflict: Asserted freshwater/river environment vs inferred terrestrial savanna/forest land cover",
    "Land cover classification shows savanna/forest (10-30% tree cover) which conflicts with expected riparian vegetation for river surface water sampling",
    "No water features detected within 1000m radius despite being a river surface water sample",
    "Soil type (Phaeozems - wet grassland/forest soils) somewhat inconsistent with expected aquatic sediment context",
    "Geographic enrichment shows residential area classification rather than natural water body",
    "Missing elevation data in asserted fields despite availability in enriched data"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify sampling coordinates - consider if sample was taken from river channel vs riparian zone",
    "Add elevation field (297m available from enrichment) to improve geographic context",
    "Clarify land cover context - river sampling in forested/savanna watershed is plausible but should be documented",
    "Consider adding water body identification fields to distinguish aquatic sampling sites",
    "Review coordinate precision - may need more specific location within river system",
    "Add habitat description clarifying relationship between terrestrial land cover and aquatic sampling environment"
