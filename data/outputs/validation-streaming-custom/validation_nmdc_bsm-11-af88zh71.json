    "Coordinate discrepancy: 5.13 km distance between asserted coordinates (35.964792, -84.278894) and geocoded Oak Ridge location (36.0103562, -84.2696449)",
    "Soil type mismatch: Asserted soil medium conflicts with inferred Acriosols soil type from geospatial data",
    "Missing GOLD ecosystem fields: ecosystem and ecosystem_category not populated (inconsistent with some other study samples)",
    "Elevation difference: 7.4m variance between asserted (315.6m) and geospatial lookup (323.0m)"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - current coordinates may be from field GPS readings while 'Oak Ridge' refers to broader municipal area. Consider adding more specific location description.",
    "Cross-validate soil classification - reconcile asserted 'soil' env_medium with inferred 'Acriosols' soil type through additional soil analysis",
    "Populate missing ecosystem fields for consistency with study design - add ecosystem='Environmental' and ecosystem_category='Terrestrial' based on other study samples",
    "Consider coordinate precision - the 5.13km difference suggests coordinates may be plot-specific while geo_loc_name refers to general municipality",
    "Add soil_type field to complement existing soil_horizon data for better soil characterization"
