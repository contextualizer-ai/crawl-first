    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 200.33 km distance between asserted coordinates (38.9468, -96.4438) and geocoded location from 'USA: Kansas' (38.27312, -98.5821872)",
    "Land cover mismatch: Asserted as freshwater river sample but coordinates map to grassland area according to all land cover classification systems (IGBP, LCCS, UMD, etc.)",
    "Environmental context conflict: Sample described as river surface water but nearest water feature is 706.9 meters away from asserted coordinates",
    "Potential sample location error: Coordinates appear to be in terrestrial grassland rather than aquatic environment",
    "Schema format issue: geo_loc_name 'USA: Kansas' is too broad - should include specific region/locality for a river sample"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - either update to actual river sampling location or confirm if coordinates represent nearby land reference point",
    "Update geo_loc_name to include specific river name and locality (e.g., 'USA: Kansas, [County Name], [River Name]') following NMDC schema expectations",
    "Add specific sampling site details to clarify exact location within river system",
    "Cross-reference with field notes to resolve coordinate vs. environmental description discrepancy",
    "Consider adding elevation data to asserted metadata for better geographic context",
    "Validate coordinates against other samples from same study to check for systematic location errors"
