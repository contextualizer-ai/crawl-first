    "MAJOR: Semantic conflict between env_medium 'epipsammon' (sand-associated biofilm) and inferred land cover showing 'Deciduous Broadleaf Forest' with >60% tree cover",
    "MODERATE: 2.45 km discrepancy between asserted coordinates and geocoded location name coordinates",
    "MODERATE: Environment triad hierarchy issues - 'epipsammon' medium not typically found in forest environments",
    "MINOR: Elevation difference of 9m between asserted (579m) and geospatial lookup (570m)",
    "CRITICAL: Major ecosystem mismatch - sample claims aquatic biofilm substrate but location shows dense forest coverage",
    "MODERATE: No soil type data despite terrestrial forest land cover classification"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify sample collection location - reconcile aquatic 'epipsammon' medium with forest land cover data",
    "Validate coordinates against field collection records - 2.45km difference suggests potential data entry error",
    "Review environmental triad hierarchy: consider if 'epipsammon' is appropriate for this forest stream environment",
    "Cross-reference with other LeConte Creek samples (nmdc:bsm-12-fapnfd98) for consistency patterns",
    "Consider updating env_medium to more appropriate aquatic terms if sample was from stream within forest",
    "Add ecosystem/ecosystem_category fields to match study design (currently null)",
    "Verify geo_loc_name geocoding accuracy - may need more specific location descriptor"
