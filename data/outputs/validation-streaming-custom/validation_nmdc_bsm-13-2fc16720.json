  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Validate and correct all ENVO ontology terms in environmental triad",
    "Add valid env_broad_scale term (suggest ENVO:01000253 'freshwater wetland biome' or ENVO:01000449 'peatland')",
    "Replace invalid env_local_scale with appropriate peatland-specific term",
    "Replace invalid env_medium with appropriate peat/organic soil term",
    "Investigate coordinate accuracy - location may not represent true peatland environment",
    "Cross-reference with study site documentation to verify environmental context",
    "Consider reclassifying ecosystem fields to match actual land cover data",
    "Add elevation data to asserted fields (428m available from inference)",
    "Verify sample collection coordinates against Marcel Experimental Forest boundaries"
