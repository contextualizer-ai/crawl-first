    "CRITICAL: Major coordinate discrepancy - 310km distance between asserted coordinates (46.121, -123.2707) and geocoded location (43.9792797, -120.737257) from 'USA: Oregon'",
    "MAJOR: Severe ecosystem alignment mismatch - asserted rhizosphere/soil environment conflicts with inferred grassland land cover data",
    "MODERATE: Asserted coords map to wetland/waterway area (13 water features, 2 wetlands within 1km) but sample describes rhizosphere soil",
    "MODERATE: Land cover data shows grassland systems which don't align with poplar rhizosphere research context",
    "MINOR: Elevation difference of 3m between asserted (1.0m) and geospatial lookup (4.0m)",
    "SCHEMA: geo_loc_name format 'USA: Oregon' is too broad - should include specific region name per NMDC schema"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinates - current coordinates appear to be incorrect for Clatskanie, Oregon poplar site",
    "Validate sample collection location against study design - coordinates should match poplar common garden site in Clatskanie",
    "Update geo_loc_name to include specific region (e.g., 'USA: Oregon: Columbia County' or 'USA: Oregon: Clatskanie')",
    "Cross-reference coordinates with other samples from same study site to ensure consistency",
    "Consider updating ecosystem metadata if land cover data suggests different environmental context than described",
    "Verify elevation measurements against known topography of collection site"
