    "Coordinate discrepancy: 10.52 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.013, -93.743) and geocoded location from 'USA: Iowa, Ames' (42.0267567, -93.6170448)",
    "Location mismatch: Asserted coordinates place sample in Boone County, but geocoded Ames location is in Story County",
    "Elevation variance: 39m difference between asserted elevation at coordinates (324m) and geocoded Ames elevation (286m)",
    "Schema format compliance: geo_loc_name format 'USA: Iowa, Ames' follows expected pattern but coordinates don't match this location",
    "Environmental context discrepancy: Asserted coordinates show cemetery and fence features rather than active agricultural land"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - confirm whether sample was collected at (42.013, -93.743) in Boone County or near Ames in Story County",
    "If coordinates are correct, update geo_loc_name to reflect actual county (Boone County) rather than Ames",
    "If Ames location is correct, update coordinates to match Story County location near Iowa State University research facilities",
    "Cross-reference with field collection logs and other samples from the same study to verify sampling locations",
    "Consider adding more specific location descriptors in geo_loc_name for agricultural research sites",
    "Validate elevation data against topographic maps for the confirmed location"
