  "issues": [
    "Major elevation discrepancy: asserted 241.8m vs. inferred 0.0m (wetland-level elevation)",
    "Semantic conflict: Asserted 'evergreen forest' vs. inferred 'savanna/woody savanna' land cover types",
    "Inconsistent vegetation description: 'area of evergreen forest' vs. multiple land cover classifications suggesting open woodland/savanna",
    "Soil type mismatch: Inferred 'Gleysols' (wetland soils) conflicts with asserted terrestrial forest environment",
    "Potential geographic misalignment: Forest environment claimed but proximity to stream and wetland characteristics suggested",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields that are present in other study samples",
    "Land cover classification uncertainty with multiple conflicting systems (evergreen vs. savanna vs. woody savanna)"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify elevation measurement - significant discrepancy suggests potential coordinate or measurement error",
    "Re-examine environmental classification - reconcile 'evergreen forest' assertion with savanna land cover inferences",
    "Consider wetland influence in environmental description given Gleysols soil type and stream proximity",
    "Add missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields for consistency with study design",
    "Validate coordinates against known sampling locations in Caribou-Poker Creeks Research Watershed",
    "Review land cover classification methodology to resolve conflicting vegetation type descriptions",
    "Consider environmental gradient description rather than single forest type given mixed land cover signals"
