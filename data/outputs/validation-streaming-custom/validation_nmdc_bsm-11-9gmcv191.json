    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 310.23 km distance between asserted coordinates (46.1208, -123.2691) and geocoded Oregon coordinates (43.9792797, -120.737257)",
    "Asserted coordinates place sample near Clatskanie, Columbia County while geocoded coordinates point to central Oregon",
    "geo_loc_name format 'USA: Oregon' is too broad - should specify region/county for proper NMDC compliance",
    "Host-associated ecosystem classification may not fully capture rhizosphere complexity - soil environment is equally important",
    "Land cover shows deciduous broadleaf forest which partially conflicts with poplar common garden experimental setting"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - use Clatskanie, Oregon coordinates if that's the actual collection site",
    "Update geo_loc_name to 'USA: Oregon, Columbia County' or 'USA: Oregon, Clatskanie' for better specificity",
    "Consider dual ecosystem classification to capture both host-associated and soil environmental aspects",
    "Validate land cover interpretation against experimental common garden setup",
    "Cross-reference coordinates with other samples from the same study site for consistency",
    "Add more specific location metadata to distinguish from natural forest environments"
