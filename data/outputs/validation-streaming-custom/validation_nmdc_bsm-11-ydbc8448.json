    "Coordinate discrepancy: 10.52 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.013, -93.743) and geocoded location from 'USA: Iowa, Ames' (42.0267567, -93.6170448)",
    "Different county locations: Asserted coords place sample in Boone County, while geocoded location is in Story County",
    "Limited environmental features near asserted coordinates - only cemetery and fence within 1000m radius",
    "Weather station data sourced from 9.5 km away, reducing precision",
    "geo_loc_name format could be more specific - lacks detailed locality information beyond city level"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and reconcile coordinate discrepancy - confirm whether sample was collected at asserted coordinates or closer to Ames city center",
    "Add more specific locality information to geo_loc_name field (e.g., farm name, field identifier, or street address)",
    "Cross-reference with field collection logs to determine correct sampling location",
    "Consider adding GPS accuracy/precision metadata to indicate coordinate reliability",
    "Validate coordinates against other samples from the same study chronosequence to ensure spatial consistency",
    "Add environmental context fields describing the specific agricultural field characteristics"
