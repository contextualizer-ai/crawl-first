  "issues": [
    "Major semantic conflict: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' vs inferred land cover showing 'Deciduous Broadleaf Vegetation' and 'Woody Savannas' - these are inconsistent with the stated agricultural field context",
    "Environmental hierarchy inconsistency: temperate woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil creates a logical conflict where woodland biome doesn't align with agricultural land use",
    "Coordinate discrepancy: 4.53km distance between asserted coordinates (44.296098, -85.199612) and geocoded location for 'Lake City, Michigan' (44.335287, -85.215046)",
    "Land cover mismatch: All inferred land cover systems show forest/woodland/savanna vegetation, conflicting with the agricultural field designation and switchgrass cultivation",
    "Ecosystem designation conflict: Sample classified as 'Agricultural land' but environmental context suggests forested/woodland area with streams and wetlands nearby",
    "Temporal inconsistency: Inferred land cover data from 2016 shows woody vegetation, but sample collected from switchgrass agricultural field - suggests land use change not captured in remote sensing data"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - consider using GPS coordinates from actual sampling location rather than general town coordinates",
    "Re-evaluate env_broad_scale assignment - if sample is truly from agricultural field, consider 'anthropogenic terrestrial biome' [ENVO:01000219] instead of 'temperate woodland biome'",
    "Add temporal land use context to metadata - note if agricultural conversion occurred recently (post-2016) which would explain land cover/vegetation discrepancy",
    "Include more precise geo_loc_name with field/farm identifier to distinguish from general Lake City coordinates",
    "Consider adding land_use_history field to capture recent conversion from woodland to agricultural use",
    "Validate env_broad_scale against actual field conditions at time of sampling rather than relying on broad regional biome classification",
    "Cross-reference coordinates with other samples from same study to ensure geographic consistency within the research design"
