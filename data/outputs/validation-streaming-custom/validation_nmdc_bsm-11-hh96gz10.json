    "Coordinate discrepancy: 4.44 km difference between asserted coordinates (42.476365, -85.451887) and geocoded location (42.4997581, -85.4080641)",
    "Elevation inconsistency: 206m difference between asserted elevation (500m) and geospatial lookup (294m)",
    "Semantic mismatch: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' conflicts with inferred savanna land cover classification",
    "Agricultural context conflict: Sample described as 'agricultural field' and 'farm soil' but land cover data indicates woodland/savanna vegetation",
    "Environmental triad inconsistency: Woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil hierarchy doesn't align with inferred savanna ecosystem",
    "Land cover contradiction: Multiple systems classify location as savanna/deciduous woodland, conflicting with agricultural designation"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - consider using geocoded coordinates (42.4997581, -85.4080641) if location name is accurate",
    "Update elevation to 294m based on geospatial lookup, or verify field measurement if 500m is correct",
    "Reconcile env_broad_scale with land cover data - consider 'agricultural ecosystem' or 'managed grassland' instead of 'temperate woodland biome'",
    "Review environmental triad: woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil may not be appropriate for a switchgrass research site",
    "Consider updating env_broad_scale to match actual land use: 'anthropogenic terrestrial biome' or 'agricultural ecosystem'",
    "Validate sample collection location - ensure coordinates correspond to actual switchgrass field rather than nearby natural area",
    "Cross-reference with other study samples to ensure consistent environmental classification across the research project"
