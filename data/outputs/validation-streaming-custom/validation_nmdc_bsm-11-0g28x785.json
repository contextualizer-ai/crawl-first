    "Elevation discrepancy: 8.6m difference between asserted (172.4m) and geospatial lookup (181.0m)",
    "geo_loc_name format not fully INSDC compliant - should be 'United States: Puerto Rico, Guanica Forest'",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields that are present in some other study samples",
    "Collection location shows 'area of evergreen forest' but enriched data indicates 'Evergreen Broadleaf Forests' - minor terminology difference",
    "Limited environmental features detected in geospatial lookup (only paths/trails)",
    "pH value of 7.59 is relatively high for typical forest soil"

  "recommendations": [
    "Update geo_loc_name to follow INSDC format: 'United States: Puerto Rico, Guanica Forest'",
    "Verify elevation measurement or update to match geospatial reference (181.0m)",
    "Consider adding ecosystem='Environmental' and ecosystem_category='Terrestrial' for consistency with other study samples",
    "Validate pH measurement - 7.59 seems high for forest soil (typically 4.5-6.5)",
    "Enhance geospatial enrichment to capture more detailed environmental features around the collection site",
    "Cross-reference elevation with multiple sources to ensure accuracy",
