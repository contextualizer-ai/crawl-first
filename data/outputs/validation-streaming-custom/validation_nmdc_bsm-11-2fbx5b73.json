    "Coordinate discrepancy: 4.53 km distance between asserted coords (44.296098, -85.199612) and geocoded location for Lake City, Michigan",
    "Land cover conflict: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' vs inferred mixed agricultural/forest systems with 10-60% tree cover",
    "Ecosystem mismatch: Agricultural field designation conflicts with inferred deciduous forest and savanna characteristics",
    "Environmental hierarchy inconsistency: Woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil sequence doesn't align with natural forest indicators from land cover data",
    "Schema format issue: geo_loc_name format 'USA: Michigan, Lake City' should follow 'country: region, specific location' pattern more precisely"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinates against Lake City, Michigan boundaries - current coords may be in rural agricultural area outside city limits",
    "Reconcile woodland biome classification with agricultural ecosystem designation - consider using agricultural biome term or mixed land use biome",
    "Update env_broad_scale to reflect actual land use - consider 'anthropogenic terrestrial biome' or 'agricultural biome' terms",
    "Validate sample location using field notes or GPS data from collection to resolve coordinate uncertainty",
    "Consider adding land use history context to experimental_factor_other field to explain woodland-to-agriculture transition",
    "Review geo_loc_name format to ensure INSDC compliance - consider 'USA: Michigan, Missaukee County' based on geocoding results",
    "Add temporal context about land conversion from natural woodland to agricultural use if applicable"
