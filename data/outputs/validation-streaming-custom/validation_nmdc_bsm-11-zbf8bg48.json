    "Coordinate mismatch: 4.44 km difference between asserted coords (42.476365, -85.451887) and geocoded location from 'USA: Michigan, Delton'",
    "Major elevation discrepancy: 206m difference between asserted (500m) vs geospatial lookup (294m)",
    "Critical ecosystem conflict: Asserted 'temperate woodland biome' and 'agricultural field' contradict inferred 'Woody Savannas/Open Forests' land cover",
    "Environment hierarchy inconsistency: 'temperate woodland biome' \u2192 'agricultural field' \u2192 'farm soil' lacks logical coherence",
    "Land cover mismatch: All inferred systems indicate woody/forest vegetation but asserted data claims agricultural field with switchgrass",
    "Seasonal collection timing: August 2018 collection may not align with dominant deciduous vegetation patterns",
    "Study context deviation: Sample shows different environmental characteristics compared to other study samples from same location"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - use either asserted coords or geocoded coords consistently, not both conflicting values",
    "Re-validate elevation measurement - significant 206m discrepancy suggests measurement or transcription error",
    "Reconcile ecosystem classification: If truly agricultural, land cover should show cropland/grassland, not woody vegetation",
    "Revise env_broad_scale: Consider 'agricultural biome' or 'grassland biome' instead of 'temperate woodland biome' if site is agricultural",
    "Clarify land use history: Site may be transitional agricultural-to-forest or forest-edge agricultural requiring more specific classification",
    "Add temporal context: Specify if switchgrass is monoculture crop or part of restoration/mixed system",
    "Cross-validate with other study samples: Ensure consistent methodology and classification across study",
    "Consider using 'agricultural ecosystem' or 'managed grassland' terms that better reflect switchgrass cultivation context"
