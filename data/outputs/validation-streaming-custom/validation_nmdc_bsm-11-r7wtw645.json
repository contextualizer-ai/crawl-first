    "Coordinate mismatch: 5.32 km distance between asserted coordinates (32.974426, -87.42694) and geocoded location from geo_loc_name",
    "Administrative inconsistency: Asserted coordinates place sample in Hale County, but geo_loc_name suggests Talladega National Forest which is primarily in Talladega County",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 62m difference between geocoded elevation (143.0m) and asserted elevation (83.9m) suggests potential coordinate error",
    "Forest type inconsistency: Asserted env_local_scale is 'area of deciduous forest' but inferred land cover shows 'Mixed Forests' and 'area of mixed forest'",
    "Missing ecosystem/ecosystem_category fields that are present in many other study samples",
    "Soil type mismatch potential: Cambisol soil type from geospatial data may not align with M horizon designation"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinates against field collection records - current coordinates may be incorrect given large distance from expected Talladega National Forest location",
    "Cross-reference sample collection location with NEON site documentation to confirm correct coordinates and administrative boundaries",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with other study samples",
    "Reconcile forest type classification - consider updating env_local_scale to 'area of mixed forest' based on multiple land cover datasets",
    "Validate elevation measurement against topographic data for the corrected location",
    "Review soil horizon designation (M horizon) for consistency with cambisol soil classification",
    "Consider adding more specific location descriptor within Talladega National Forest for better geographic precision"
