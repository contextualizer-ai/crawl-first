    "Major semantic conflict: asserted env_local_scale 'area of evergreen forest' contradicts all inferred land cover data showing 'deciduous broadleaf forest'",
    "Environmental triad inconsistency: evergreen forest claim not supported by remote sensing data from multiple classification systems",
    "Coordinate discrepancy: 0.68 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location name",
    "Temperature-season mismatch: 14.7\u00b0C in July seems unusually cool for Wisconsin summer",
    "Soil type mismatch: inferred Podzols vs typical deciduous forest soils",
    "Collection date temporal mismatch with available land cover data (2017 collection vs 2018 land cover)"

  "recommendations": [
    "CRITICAL: Verify env_local_scale classification - field observation needed to confirm forest type (evergreen vs deciduous)",
    "Cross-validate coordinates with field notes - choose between asserted coordinates or location name geocoding",
    "Validate temperature measurement - 14.7\u00b0C in July Wisconsin seems low for surface soil",
    "Consider updating land cover data source to match collection year (2017)",
    "Add forest composition metadata to clarify mixed vs pure forest stands",
    "Include field photos or vegetation survey data to support environmental classifications",
    "Verify sampling depth consistency with soil horizon designation (O horizon at 0-0.039m)",
    "Add coordinate precision metadata to indicate GPS accuracy"
