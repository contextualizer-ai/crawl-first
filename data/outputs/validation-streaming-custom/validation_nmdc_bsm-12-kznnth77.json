    "Coordinate discrepancy: 1.31 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from McRae Creek name",

    "Elevation mismatch: 32m difference between asserted (876m) and geospatial lookup (908m)",
    "Conflicting environmental context: Sample claims aquatic freshwater environment but coordinates place it in dense forest with no water features nearby",

    "Verify and correct coordinates - 1.31km discrepancy suggests potential data entry error",

    "Consider if sample was collected from a small stream not detected by satellite data",
    "Add missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields for GOLD pathway consistency",
