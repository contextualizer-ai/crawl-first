    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 310.29 km distance between asserted coordinates (46.1214, -123.2694) and geocoded location (43.9792797, -120.737257) for Oregon",
    "Semantic conflict: Asserted 'botanical garden' ecosystem subtype conflicts with inferred grassland land cover classification",
    "Environmental inconsistency: Asserted 'garden' environment contradicts inferred natural grassland/wetland ecosystem with waterways and ditches",
    "Location specificity mismatch: Asserted coordinates point to specific location near Clatskanie but geocoded Oregon center coordinates lack precision",
    "Ecosystem classification conflict: Bulk soil from botanical garden vs. natural grassland area classification",
    "Study context inconsistency: This sample differs from other study samples which are primarily host-associated plant samples"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate data - check if coordinates should be (46.1214, -123.2694) near Clatskanie or if location should match Oregon state center",
    "Resolve ecosystem classification - clarify if sample is from managed botanical garden or natural grassland environment",
    "Update env_local_scale to reflect actual sampling environment - consider terms like 'managed garden area' if truly from botanical garden",
    "Add more specific location details to geo_loc_name field following NMDC format (e.g., 'USA: Oregon: Columbia County: Clatskanie')",
    "Cross-validate with other study samples to ensure consistent metadata practices",
    "Consider updating ecosystem_subtype if location is actually natural grassland rather than botanical garden",
    "Verify elevation data consistency between asserted (1.0m) and geospatial lookup (4.0m) values"
