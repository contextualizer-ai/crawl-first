    "Coordinate mismatch: 1.71 km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from Talladega National Forest",

    "Missing ecosystem/ecosystem_category fields in some study samples suggests potential data inconsistency",
    "Collection temperature (22.4\u00b0C) is cooler than weather station data (25.7\u00b0C average) - may indicate sampling depth effect or temporal variation"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - consider using geocoded coordinates (32.9349471, -87.3948069) if they better represent the actual sampling location within Talladega National Forest",
    "Cross-reference elevation with topographic maps or GPS readings to determine which value is more accurate",
    "Ensure consistent ecosystem field population across all study samples for better data completeness",
    "Document any factors affecting temperature measurements (soil depth, time of day, microclimate effects)",
    "Consider adding coordinate precision/uncertainty metadata to indicate measurement confidence"
