    "Coordinate mismatch: 2.24 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from geo_loc_name",

    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields that are present in other study samples",

    "geo_loc_name format not fully NMDC compliant - missing specific location detail after region"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - consider using geocoded coordinates (38.8847957, -78.1461968) which are closer to the named location",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with other study samples",
    "Improve geo_loc_name format to: 'USA: Virginia, Warren County, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute' for better NMDC compliance",
    "Validate and update elevation value using geospatial data (570m appears more accurate)",
    "Add ontology mapping for Acriosols soil type to improve data interoperability",
    "Consider adding more specific environmental context fields based on the rich inferred land cover data available"
