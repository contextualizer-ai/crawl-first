    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 35.23 km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location",

    "Scrubland assertion contradicts observed forest/woodland vegetation patterns",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields present in other study samples",

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - consider using geocoded coordinates (44.6200885, -110.5606893) if location name is accurate",
    "Review env_local_scale classification: 'area of scrub' appears inconsistent with inferred evergreen needleleaf forest/savanna ecosystem",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with study pattern",
    "Clarify soil horizon designation - M horizon at 0-0.32m depth needs verification",
    "Consider updating environmental ontology terms to better reflect the mixed forest-savanna ecosystem indicated by land cover data"
