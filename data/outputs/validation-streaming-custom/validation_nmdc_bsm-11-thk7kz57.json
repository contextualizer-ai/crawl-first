    "Coordinate mismatch: 4.44 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.476365, -85.451887) and geocoded location from 'USA: Michigan, Delton' (42.4997581, -85.4080641)",
    "Land cover conflict: Asserted 'agricultural field' with 'farm soil' conflicts with inferred land cover showing savanna/woodland characteristics (10-30% tree cover)",
    "Environmental hierarchy inconsistency: env_broad_scale 'temperate woodland biome' does not align well with asserted agricultural context",
    "Semantic conflict: Sample claimed as 'agricultural field' but inferred land cover suggests savanna/sparse forest ecosystem",
    "Geographic inconsistency: Asserted coordinates place sample in Prairieville, but geo_loc_name indicates Delton (4.44 km apart)"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - determine if coordinates should match Delton (42.4997581, -85.4080641) or if location name should be updated to Prairieville",
    "Re-examine environmental classification: if truly agricultural, consider env_broad_scale terms like 'anthropogenic terrestrial biome' rather than 'temperate woodland biome'",
    "Cross-validate land cover data with field observations - agricultural switchgrass fields should not show 10-30% tree cover",
    "Update ecosystem hierarchy to be internally consistent: agricultural field \u2192 crop field \u2192 farm soil is more appropriate than woodland \u2192 agricultural \u2192 farm",
    "Consider temporal aspects: verify if land use changed between 2017 collection and 2018 land cover data",
    "Standardize coordinate precision and validate against known field site locations within the study"
