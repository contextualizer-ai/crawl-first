    "Coordinate mismatch: 26.11 km difference between asserted coords (35.9076, -79.0506) and geocoded location (35.6729639, -79.0392919)",
    "Major elevation discrepancy: asserted 0.0m vs inferred 140.0m (difference of 140m)",
    "Ecosystem conflict: Host-associated plant rhizosphere sample located in urban biome environment",
    "Land cover contradiction: All land cover systems classify location as 'Urban and Built-up Lands' but sample is from Arabidopsis rhizosphere",
    "Geographic context mismatch: Sample coordinates place it at UNC Chapel Hill campus, not typical agricultural/natural Arabidopsis habitat",
    "Zero elevation claim implausible for inland North Carolina location",
    "Urban university setting inconsistent with plant rhizosphere microbiome study design"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - current coords appear to be at UNC Chapel Hill rather than actual sampling site",
    "Update elevation to realistic value for inland North Carolina (should be ~140m based on geospatial data)",
    "Clarify sampling context: if this was a controlled greenhouse/growth chamber study at UNC, update ecosystem fields accordingly",
    "Consider adding 'controlled environment' or 'laboratory' qualifiers to ecosystem classification",
    "Validate geo_loc_name format - should include more specific location detail beyond state level",
    "Review other samples in study for similar coordinate/location inconsistencies",
    "Add protocol documentation explaining if samples were collected from natural vs controlled environments"
