    "Coordinate mismatch: 1.79 km distance between asserted coordinates (44.119417, -89.533806) and geocoded location from 'USA: Wisconsin, Hancock' (44.133584, -89.523177)",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 168m difference between asserted elevation (500m) and geospatial lookup (332m) - 33% error",
    "Environmental hierarchy conflict: temperate woodland biome \u2192 agricultural field \u2192 farm soil creates semantic contradiction between 'woodland' and 'agricultural' contexts",
    "Ecosystem classification inconsistency: 'ecosystem_subtype: Agricultural land' vs 'cur_vegetation: Undisturbed Control' suggests conflicting land use states",
    "Mixed land cover signals: Inferred data shows both 'Croplands' and 'Grasslands' classifications, indicating transitional or heterogeneous land use",
    "Schema format issue: geo_loc_name format 'USA: Wisconsin, Hancock' should follow 'country: region, specific location' pattern more precisely"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinates: Cross-check asserted coordinates (44.119417, -89.533806) against field collection GPS data or use geocoded coordinates (44.133584, -89.523177) if more accurate",
    "Validate elevation: Confirm field-measured elevation or update to geospatially-derived value (332m) if asserted value is incorrect",
    "Resolve environmental hierarchy: Replace 'temperate woodland biome' with 'temperate cropland biome' or 'agricultural biome' to align with agricultural field context",
    "Clarify vegetation status: Specify whether 'Undisturbed Control' refers to unmanaged agricultural land, restored grassland, or actual undisturbed woodland within agricultural landscape",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name: Update format to 'United States: Wisconsin, Hancock' or 'USA: Wisconsin, Waushara County, Hancock' for better precision",
    "Add land use transition context: Include metadata about whether this represents agricultural-to-grassland transition or grassland-to-agricultural conversion",
    "Cross-validate with study design: Confirm this sample represents intended experimental treatment given study focus on switchgrass cropping systems"
