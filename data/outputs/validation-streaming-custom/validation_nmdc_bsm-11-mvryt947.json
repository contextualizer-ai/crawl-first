    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 63.24 km distance between asserted coordinates (32.96142, -87.40828) and geocoded Alabama center (33.2588817, -86.8295337)",
    "Major semantic conflict: River sediment sample has land cover classified as broadleaf forest/deciduous trees, not aquatic/riverine environment",
    "env_broad_scale field is missing (ENVO_01000253 term name not provided) while other study samples have 'freshwater river biome'",
    "Terrestrial forest land cover (>60% tree cover) contradicts aquatic freshwater ecosystem classification",
    "Sample collection from river sediment but surrounding area shows dense deciduous broadleaf forest rather than riparian or aquatic vegetation",
    "geo_loc_name format potentially non-compliant - should follow 'country: region, specific location' pattern but lacks specific location detail"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct the latitude/longitude coordinates - current coordinates may be inaccurate given 63km discrepancy with Alabama geocoding",
    "Add the missing env_broad_scale term name (likely 'freshwater river biome' based on other study samples)",
    "Investigate the land cover classification - river sediment samples should show riparian or aquatic vegetation, not dense forest",
    "Consider if coordinates should be adjusted to match actual Mayfield Creek location or if land cover data needs re-evaluation",
    "Enhance geo_loc_name with more specific location information following NMDC schema format: 'USA: Alabama, Bibb County' or include creek name",
    "Cross-validate with other WHONDRS samples to ensure coordinate accuracy and environmental consistency",
    "Review collection methodology to confirm sample was actually taken from riverine environment given terrestrial forest classification"
