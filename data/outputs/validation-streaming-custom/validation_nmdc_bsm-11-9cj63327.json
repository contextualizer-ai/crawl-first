    "Major coordinate discrepancy: 236 km difference between asserted coordinates (38.4897, -87.55) and geocoded location 'USA: Indiana' (40.3270127, -86.1746933)",
    "Severe semantic conflict: Sample is described as freshwater river environment but located in agricultural cropland according to land cover data",
    "Location mismatch: Asserted coordinates point to Hazleton, Gibson County while geo_loc_name suggests central Indiana",
    "Environmental context contradiction: River biome sample in area dominated by cultivated cropland (60%+ coverage)",
    "Land cover types (Croplands, Herbaceous Croplands, Cereal Croplands) fundamentally incompatible with freshwater river sampling",
    "OSM data confirms White River monitoring station only 8m away but coordinates don't match geocoded state location",
    "Study consistency issue: Other samples show similar coordinate/geo_loc_name patterns suggesting systematic data quality problems"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - determine if (38.4897, -87.55) or geocoded Indiana location is accurate",
    "If coordinates are correct, update geo_loc_name to 'USA: Gibson County, Indiana' or 'USA: Hazleton, Indiana' for specificity",
    "Validate sample collection site - confirm if sample was actually collected from White River or if coordinates are incorrect",
    "Cross-reference with field notes and original sampling records to resolve location discrepancy",
    "Review land cover interpretation - river samples may appear in agricultural areas but should reflect aquatic environment",
    "Consider updating geo_loc_name format to include county/locality for better precision following INSDC guidelines",
    "Implement coordinate validation checks across the entire study dataset",
    "Add quality control flags for samples with coordinate/location mismatches",
    "Verify collection methodology matches study description of river microbiome sampling"
