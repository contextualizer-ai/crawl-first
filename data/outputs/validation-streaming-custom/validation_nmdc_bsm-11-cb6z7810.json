    "Coordinate discrepancy: 4.61 km distance between asserted coordinates (45.850153, -121.989672) and geocoded location from geo_loc_name",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields that are present in other study samples",
    "Soil type classification 'Xerosols' from coordinates does not align with expected Pacific Northwest forest soils",
    "Collection temperature (10.1\u00b0C) is significantly lower than weather station data (15.5\u00b0C average) for same date"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - consider using geocoded coordinates (45.8090043, -121.9823059) which align better with Wind River Experimental Forest",
    "Add missing ecosystem='Environmental' and ecosystem_category='Terrestrial' fields for consistency with other study samples",
    "Review soil classification - Xerosols are typically arid climate soils, inconsistent with Pacific Northwest evergreen forest environment",
    "Cross-validate temperature measurements with local weather conditions and sampling methodology",
    "Consider adding more specific location details within Wind River Experimental Forest for better spatial resolution"
