    "Coordinate mismatch: 5.18 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from geo_loc_name",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 13.4m difference between asserted (38.6m) and geospatial lookup (52.0m)",
    "Land cover conflict: Inferred savanna/sparse forest conflicts with asserted deciduous forest environment",
    "Environmental context mismatch: Limited environmental features at coordinates vs. expected forest ecosystem",
    "Ecosystem subtype 'Unclassified' lacks specificity for data interpretation",
    "Temperature measurement lacks decimal precision for scientific accuracy"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - use geocoded coordinates (31.2408992, -84.4775134) if sampling occurred at The Jones Center",
    "Update elevation to 52.0m based on geospatial lookup or verify original measurement",
    "Reconcile environmental classification - determine if site is deciduous forest or savanna/sparse woodland",
    "Specify ecosystem_subtype beyond 'Unclassified' to improve data utility",
    "Add decimal precision to temperature measurement (e.g., 27.0\u00b0C instead of 27\u00b0C)",
    "Consider adding environmental context fields like vegetation density or forest structure",
    "Validate sampling location within The Jones Center boundaries",
    "Review collection protocol to ensure consistent coordinate recording"
