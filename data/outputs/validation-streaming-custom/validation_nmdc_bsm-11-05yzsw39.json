    "CRITICAL: 50 km discrepancy between asserted coordinates (64.8558, -147.8335) and geocoded location (64.8649039, -146.7751619) from geo_loc_name",
    "Major semantic conflict: env_broad_scale (ENVO:00000446 - terrestrial biome) vs inferred land cover (grassland) inconsistent with permafrost study context",
    "Environmental hierarchy incomplete: Missing specific ENVO IDs for env_broad_scale and env_local_scale terms in metadata",
    "Ecosystem fields completely missing despite being part of structured permafrost ecosystem study",
    "Land cover classification as 'grassland' conflicts with expected boreal forest/tundra environment for Fairbanks permafrost research",
    "Collection site 'Dalton Highway, Alaska' suggests remote location but coordinates place sample at University of Alaska Fairbanks campus",
    "Study context indicates permafrost sampling but inferred soil type (Gleysols - wetland soils) doesn't align with typical permafrost soils"

  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinate data - 50km discrepancy suggests data entry error or coordinate system confusion",
    "Cross-reference sample collection site description with actual GPS coordinates used in field work",
    "Add missing ecosystem, ecosystem_category, and ecosystem_type fields appropriate for Alaska permafrost environments",
    "Verify env_broad_scale and env_local_scale ENVO term selections - current terms may not accurately represent permafrost study environment",
    "Review land cover interpretation - university campus location conflicts with expected remote permafrost sampling site",
    "Consider adding elevation data to support coordinate validation",
    "Validate that sample metadata aligns with published study methodology focusing on permafrost landscapes",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name format to follow NMDC schema requirements more precisely",
    "Review other samples in study (nmdc:sty-11-db67n062) for consistent geographic and environmental metadata patterns"
