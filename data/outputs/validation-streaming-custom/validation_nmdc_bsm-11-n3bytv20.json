    "Elevation discrepancy: 206m difference between asserted (500m) and geospatial (294m)",
    "Environmental contradiction: agricultural field descriptor conflicts with deciduous woodland land cover",

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate precision - consider using geocoded coordinates (42.4997581, -85.4080641) which better match Delton, MI",
    "Reconcile ecosystem classification - if truly agricultural, update env_broad_scale from woodland to agricultural biome",
    "Clarify experimental design - resolve contradiction between 'Undisturbed Control' and 'Fertilized' treatments",
    "Update elevation to geospatially-derived value (294m) for better accuracy",
    "Review land cover interpretation - if sample is from agricultural field within woodland matrix, specify this clearly",
    "Standardize vegetation classification to match actual land use and experimental treatment"
