    "Geographic coordinate discrepancy: 4.02 km difference between asserted coords (38.5326, -121.783) and geocoded location for 'USA: California, Davis' (38.5435526, -121.739005)",
    "Study location inconsistency: Study title mentions Berkeley but sample location is Davis - possible data entry error",
    "Ecosystem classification conflict: Asserted as 'Host-associated' but inferred land cover shows 'Croplands' and 'Grasslands' suggesting environmental rather than plant-host sample",
    "env_medium 'rhizosphere' vs land cover 'croplands' - inconsistent with controlled experimental setting described in study",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 2m difference between asserted (16m) and geospatial lookup (18m)",
    "Schema compliance: geo_loc_name format should follow 'country: region, specific location' pattern more precisely"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinates: Check if coordinates (38.5326, -121.783) represent actual sampling location or if geocoded Davis coordinates (38.5435526, -121.739005) are more accurate",
    "Clarify study location: Resolve discrepancy between study title mentioning Berkeley and sample location being Davis",
    "Review ecosystem classification: Consider if this should be 'Environmental/Terrestrial' rather than 'Host-associated/Plants' based on cropland land cover data",
    "Validate experimental design: Confirm if samples were collected from controlled growth chamber (as per study title) or field conditions (as per growth_facil field)",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name format: Use 'USA: California, Davis' format consistently with NMDC schema",
    "Cross-validate with study protocol: Ensure sample metadata aligns with published methodology and other samples in study",
    "Consider ecosystem hierarchy: If this is rhizosphere sampling, ensure land cover data reflects the experimental setup rather than broader agricultural context"
