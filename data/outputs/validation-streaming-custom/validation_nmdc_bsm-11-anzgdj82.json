    "Significant coordinate mismatch: 37.19 km distance between asserted coordinates (44.954277, -110.541571) and geocoded coordinates from location name (44.6200885, -110.5606893)",
    "Environmental context conflict: Asserted env_local_scale 'area of scrub' (ENVO:01000869) conflicts with inferred land cover showing grassland/herbaceous vegetation dominance",
    "Coordinate precision issue: Asserted coordinates resolve to 'Blacktail Plateau Drive' rather than the broader 'Yellowstone National Park' location",
    "Land cover mismatch: All inferred land cover systems indicate grassland/herbaceous vegetation, but asserted local scale indicates scrub area",
    "Study inconsistency: Some samples in study have missing ecosystem/ecosystem_category fields while this sample has complete GOLD pathway"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - 37km discrepancy is substantial and may indicate data entry error",
    "Re-evaluate env_local_scale assignment - consider 'grassland area' (ENVO:00000106) instead of 'area of scrub' based on land cover data",
    "Add coordinate validation step to ensure asserted coordinates match intended sampling location within Yellowstone",
    "Cross-reference with field sampling records to confirm actual vegetation type at sampling location",
    "Standardize ecosystem field completion across all study samples for consistency",
    "Consider adding soil type validation against inferred luvisol classification"
