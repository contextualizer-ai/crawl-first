  "issues": [
    "Major coordinate mismatch: 37.45 km difference between asserted coordinates and geocoded location from geo_loc_name",
    "Environmental hierarchy conflict: env_local_scale 'evergreen forest' conflicts with inferred land cover showing 'savannas' and sparse/open forests (10-30% tree cover)",
    "Semantic inconsistency: Asserted 'area of evergreen forest' vs inferred 'Evergreen Needleleaf Trees' with only 10-30% tree cover suggests more open woodland/savanna than dense forest",
    "Location context mismatch: Asserted coordinates place sample near Garnet Hill with bare rock/scree features, inconsistent with dense evergreen forest classification",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields that are present in other study samples",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 518m difference between asserted coordinates (1901m) and geocoded location (2419m)",
    "OSM features show natural:bare_rock and natural:scree as nearest features, contradicting forest environment classification"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - 37.45km discrepancy suggests data entry error or coordinate system confusion",
    "Reassess env_local_scale classification - consider 'sparse forest', 'woodland', or 'montane grassland' instead of 'evergreen forest' based on 10-30% tree cover",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields for consistency with study design",
    "Review sample collection location - GPS coordinates may be incorrect given mismatch with Yellowstone Park centroid",
    "Consider updating env_local_scale to better reflect the rocky, mountainous terrain indicated by OSM features (bare rock, scree)",
    "Validate collection methodology - ensure coordinates represent actual sampling location rather than general area reference",
    "Cross-reference with field notes to determine if sample was collected in forest patch within broader savanna/woodland landscape"
