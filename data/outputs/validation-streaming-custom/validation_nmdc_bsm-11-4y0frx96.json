    "Coordinate discrepancy: 3.96 km distance between asserted (50.91020354498825, 6.414313738007794) and geocoded coordinates (50.9220931, 6.3611015) from location name 'Germany: Nordrhein-Westfalen, Julich'",
    "Land cover inconsistency: Inferred land cover shows 'Woody Savannas' and 'Open Forests' but sample is from controlled laboratory greenhouse environment at Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich",
    "Elevation mismatch: 8.0m difference between asserted elevation (100.0m) and geospatial lookup (92.0m)",
    "Environmental context mismatch: Asserted plant-associated/rhizosphere environment conflicts with inferred savanna/woodland land cover classifications"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate precision - the 3.96 km discrepancy suggests potential coordinate entry error or imprecise geocoding",
    "Add metadata field to clearly distinguish laboratory/greenhouse samples from field samples to avoid land cover misinterpretation",
    "Consider using building-specific coordinates for Forschungszentrum J\u00fclich greenhouse facilities rather than general campus coordinates",
    "Include facility-specific environmental descriptors (e.g., 'controlled environment', 'greenhouse') in environmental metadata to clarify sampling context",
    "Cross-validate elevation data with facility specifications or use higher-resolution elevation datasets for research campus locations"
