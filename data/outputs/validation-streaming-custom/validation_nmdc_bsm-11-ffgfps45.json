    "CRITICAL: Massive coordinate mismatch - asserted coordinates (42.77, -70.92) in Massachusetts vs geocoded location in Ohio, distance 829.44 km",
    "Location name misspelling: 'Massachusettes' should be 'Massachusetts'",
    "Major ecosystem conflict: Asserted freshwater river environment vs inferred deciduous broadleaf forest land cover",
    "Semantic inconsistency: Sample named 'cartcreek' but coordinates don't align with Cart Creek location",
    "Schema violation: geo_loc_name format incorrect - should include specific region after country",
    "Environmental contradiction: River surface water sample in forest-dominated terrestrial ecosystem"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinates - either update lat_lon to match Massachusetts location or correct geo_loc_name if sample is actually from Ohio",
    "Fix spelling: Change 'Massachusettes' to 'Massachusetts' in geo_loc_name and description",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name format to 'USA: Massachusetts, Essex County' per NMDC schema",
    "Verify sample collection site - if truly from Cart Creek, ensure coordinates reflect the actual creek location",
    "Cross-reference with study protocols to confirm intended sampling location",
    "Consider adding elevation data to asserted fields (16m available from geocoding)",
    "Validate ecosystem classification against actual land cover at collection site"
