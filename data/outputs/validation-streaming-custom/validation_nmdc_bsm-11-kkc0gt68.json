    "Coordinate discrepancy: 10.52 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.013, -93.743) and geocoded location from 'USA: Iowa, Ames' (42.0267567, -93.6170448)",
    "County mismatch: Asserted coordinates resolve to Boone County while geocoded location is in Story County",
    "Limited environmental features detected near coordinates (only cemetery and fence within 1000m)",
    "Minor elevation difference: 1m between asserted (325m) and geospatial lookup (324m)",
    "geo_loc_name format deviation: Uses 'USA: Iowa, Ames' instead of standard 'United States: Iowa, Ames' format"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and reconcile coordinate discrepancy - determine if sample was collected at asserted coordinates or near Ames city center",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name format to follow INSDC guidelines: 'United States: Iowa, Ames'",
    "Add more specific location information to geo_loc_name (e.g., farm name or research station)",
    "Consider adding nearest landmark or research facility name for better geographic context",
    "Validate coordinates against study site locations mentioned in associated research",
