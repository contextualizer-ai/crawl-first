    "Critical coordinate inconsistency: Asserted coordinates (43.0995, -89.4045) for Lake Mendota are 149.79 km away from geocoded Wisconsin center (44.4308975, -89.6884637)",
    "Asserted coordinates place sample in Madison/Lake Mendota area while geo_loc_name only specifies 'USA: Wisconsin' - insufficient geographic precision",
    "Land cover classification shows 'water body' which is consistent but uses generic ENVO terms rather than lake-specific terms",
    "Date collection (August 23, 2013) is reasonable for lake sampling but weather data shows it was during late summer conditions",
    "Schema compliance issue: geo_loc_name format 'USA: Wisconsin' lacks the specific region detail recommended by NMDC schema"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "CRITICAL: Verify and correct coordinates - current asserted coordinates (43.0995, -89.4045) appear to be accurate for Lake Mendota, but geo_loc_name should be updated to 'USA: Wisconsin, Lake Mendota' or 'USA: Wisconsin, Madison'",
    "Update geo_loc_name to include specific lake/region information to match NMDC schema requirements and improve geographic precision",
    "Consider adding more specific ENVO terms for lake water environment to better align with the detailed environmental ontology hierarchy",
    "Validate that the sample is indeed from Lake Mendota as indicated by coordinates, and ensure consistency with study design",
    "Add lake-specific environmental descriptors to better characterize the freshwater lake ecosystem context"
