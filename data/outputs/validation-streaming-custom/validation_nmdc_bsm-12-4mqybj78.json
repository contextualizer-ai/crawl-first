    "Major semantic conflict: Sample asserted as stream water but coordinates locate it in deciduous broadleaf forest biome",
    "Elevation discrepancy: 23.1m difference between asserted (271.9m) and geospatial (295.0m)",
    "Environmental context mismatch: Stream sample metadata vs forest land cover classification",
    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields for GOLD pathway classification",
    "Nearest water feature (Leach Run) is 147.4m away, raising questions about sample origin"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify sample collection coordinates - current coordinates appear to be in forested area rather than stream",
    "Cross-reference field notes to confirm sample was collected from Posey Creek vs nearby Leach Run",
    "Consider updating coordinates to reflect actual stream sampling location",
