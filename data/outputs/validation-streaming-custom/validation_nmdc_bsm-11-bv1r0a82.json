    "Coordinate discrepancy: 12.13 km distance between asserted coordinates (63.8798, -149.21539) and geocoded location from 'USA: Alaska, Healy' (63.950262, -149.0258707)",
    "Missing env_broad_scale term name - only ID ENVO:00000446 provided without human-readable label",
    "Missing elevation data in asserted metadata despite being relevant for permafrost research context",
    "Inconsistent environment classification between asserted 'area of dwarf scrub' and inferred 'Open Shrublands/Deciduous Broadleaf Vegetation'",

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - investigate which location is correct: asserted coordinates or geocoded 'Healy' location",
    "Add missing term name for env_broad_scale ENVO:00000446 to improve data interpretability",
    "Include elevation data in metadata as it's critical for permafrost studies and site characterization",
    "Clarify vegetation classification discrepancy between 'dwarf scrub' and inferred land cover types",
    "Expand sample_collection_site to full NEON site name (e.g., 'Healy NEON Site - HEAL') for better identification",
    "Standardize geo_loc_name format to 'USA: Alaska, Healy' or provide more specific region information per INSDC guidelines",
    "Consider adding ecosystem, ecosystem_category, and ecosystem_type fields for better environmental context",
