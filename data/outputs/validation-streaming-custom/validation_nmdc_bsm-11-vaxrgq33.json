    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 11.57 km distance between asserted coordinates and geocoded location",
    "Major semantic conflict: asserted environment is 'sedge- and forb-dominated herbaceous vegetation' but land cover data shows grassland classification",
    "Elevation mismatch: asserted 6.3m vs geospatial lookup 0.0m elevation",
    "Location appears to be near water features (784m from water) which conflicts with terrestrial soil sampling expectation",
    "Arctic location (71.24\u00b0N) classified as grassland in global land cover data - likely classification error for tundra environment",
    "Asserted coordinates place sample in different administrative area than geocoded location name"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinates - reconcile the 11.57 km discrepancy between asserted coordinates (71.241422, -156.502856) and geocoded Utqiagvik location (71.2905366, -156.78844)",
    "Review land cover classification - Arctic tundra environment is incorrectly classified as grassland in global datasets; consider using Arctic-specific classification systems",
    "Validate elevation data - investigate 6.3m difference between asserted and geospatial elevations",
    "Clarify environmental context - reconcile 'sedge- and forb-dominated herbaceous vegetation' with proximity to water features",
    "Consider updating env_local_scale to Arctic-specific terms like 'arctic tundra' or 'permafrost-affected soil' instead of generic herbaceous vegetation",
    "Add metadata notes explaining Arctic sampling context and potential limitations of global land cover classifications"
