    "Missing ecosystem and ecosystem_category fields (inconsistent with 40% of other study samples)",
    "Soil type (Acriosols) lacks ontology mapping for better integration",
    "geo_loc_name format could be more specific - lacks specific region identifier",
    "Temperature measurement (22.6\u00b0C) differs from weather station data (26.5\u00b0C average) suggesting microenvironment effects"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify coordinate accuracy - 1.37 km discrepancy suggests potential GPS error or coordinate transcription issue",
    "Add missing ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields to match study design",
    "Map soil type 'Acriosols' to appropriate ENVO ontology term for better semantic integration",
    "Enhance geo_loc_name to include more specific regional identifier following NMDC format: 'USA: Virginia, Warren County, Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute'",
    "Document microenvironment temperature differences or verify sensor calibration",
    "Consider adding land cover classification terms to complement the strong deciduous forest signal from all remote sensing products"
