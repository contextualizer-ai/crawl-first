    "Coordinate discrepancy: 4.99 km distance between asserted coordinates (32.575696, -106.803388) and geocoded location (32.6089832, -106.7677302)",
    "Asserted coordinates place sample on County Road E085 while geo_loc_name indicates Jornada Experimental Range",
    "Land cover classification shows evergreen needleleaf vegetation and shrublands which partially conflicts with 'area of scrub' local scale",
    "Ecosystem_subtype is 'Unclassified' which lacks specificity for a well-characterized research site",
    "Missing ENVO ontology terms for all land cover classifications",
    "Environmental features query returned 0 results, suggesting possible coordinate accuracy issues"

  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - consider using the geocoded coordinates (32.6089832, -106.7677302) if they better represent the actual sampling location within Jornada Experimental Range",
    "Update ecosystem_subtype from 'Unclassified' to a more specific term like 'desert scrub' or 'arid shrubland' to match the environmental context",
    "Reconcile env_local_scale term - consider using 'shrubland' (ENVO:00000300) instead of 'area of scrub' to better align with land cover data showing shrubland dominance",
    "Add missing ENVO ontology mappings for land cover classifications to improve semantic interoperability",
    "Consider adding more environmental context fields like 'climate type' or 'vegetation type' to better characterize this arid ecosystem",
    "Validate sampling coordinates against official NEON site boundaries and update if necessary"
