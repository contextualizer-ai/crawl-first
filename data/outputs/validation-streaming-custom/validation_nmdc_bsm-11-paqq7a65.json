    "Significant coordinate discrepancy: 10.52 km distance between asserted coordinates (42.013, -93.743) and geocoded location for 'USA: Iowa, Ames' (42.0267567, -93.6170448)",
    "Asserted coordinates place sample in Boone County, while geocoded location is in Story County - potential county-level geographic mismatch",
    "Study mentions Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus research but sample metadata indicates corn ('other_treatment: Corn') - potential crop type inconsistency",
    "High nitrogen fertilization rate (300 kg/ha) may not align with typical agricultural practices for the claimed crop type",
    "Limited environmental features found near asserted coordinates (only cemetery and fence within 1000m) - may indicate rural/isolated location inconsistent with intensive agricultural research site"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Verify and correct coordinate accuracy - recommend using precise field GPS coordinates rather than general city geocoding",
    "Clarify county location (Boone vs Story County) and ensure coordinates match actual sampling location",
    "Reconcile apparent discrepancy between study focus on Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus and sample metadata indicating corn crop",
    "Validate that nitrogen fertilization rate (300 kg/ha) is appropriate for the actual crop type and experimental design",
    "Add more specific geographic descriptors to geo_loc_name field to better specify the exact research facility location within Ames area",
    "Consider adding site-specific environmental context descriptors to better characterize the agricultural research facility",
    "Cross-reference with other samples in the study to ensure consistent coordinate and location reporting"
