    "Minor elevation discrepancy: 4.8m difference between asserted (514.2m) and geospatial (519.0m)",

    "Soil horizon 'M horizon' is uncommon - typically O, A, E, B, C horizons are standard",

    "Verify elevation measurement or accept 4.8m difference as within acceptable range for GPS accuracy",
    "Correct the spelling in env_local_scale term from 'gramanoid' to 'graminoid' if possible",

    "Validate that 'M horizon' designation is appropriate for this soil context",
    "Consider enriching with seasonal vegetation patterns since collection was during peak growing season",
