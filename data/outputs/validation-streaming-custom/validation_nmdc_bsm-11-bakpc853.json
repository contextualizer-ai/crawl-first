    "Verify and reconcile coordinate discrepancy - check if asserted coordinates (39.102192, -96.56118) or geocoded coordinates (39.1002012, -96.576798) are more accurate for the actual sampling location",
    "Correct the spelling in env_local_scale from 'gramanoid' to 'graminoid' to match proper botanical terminology",
    "Add ecosystem ('Environmental') and ecosystem_category ('Terrestrial') fields to match other samples in the study",
    "Consider more specific geo_loc_name following NMDC format: 'USA: Kansas, Riley County, Konza Prairie Biological Station'",
    "Validate elevation measurement against geospatial data (9.4m difference may be within acceptable range but should be verified)",
    "Consider adding more environmental context fields like specific_ecosystem to better describe the prairie grassland environment"
