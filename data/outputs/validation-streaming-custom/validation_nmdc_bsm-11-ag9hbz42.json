  "issues": [
    "CRITICAL: Major coordinate discrepancy - 140.82 km distance between asserted coords (31.6679, -81.8403) and geocoded location for Georgia",
    "CRITICAL: Semantic conflict - Sample described as river/freshwater but asserted coordinates are in terrestrial deciduous broadleaf forest",
    "MAJOR: Asserted coordinates show terrestrial forest ecosystem while sample claims aquatic freshwater environment",
    "MAJOR: Land cover data shows 60%+ tree cover (deciduous broadleaf forest) inconsistent with surface water collection",
    "MODERATE: Sample collection site 'river surface water' not supported by coordinate-based environmental analysis",
    "MODERATE: Elevation at asserted coords (11m) vs geocoded coords (112m) shows 101m difference",
    "MINOR: No elevation field in asserted data despite NMDC schema recommendation"
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "URGENT: Verify and correct coordinates - use GPS coordinates from actual sampling location rather than approximate regional coordinates",
    "Validate sample collection site against actual coordinates to ensure aquatic environment",
    "Consider using geocoded coordinates (32.3293809, -83.1137366) if they better represent the actual sampling location",
    "Add elevation field to asserted data for better geographic context",
    "Cross-reference with field notes or GPS logs to identify correct sampling coordinates",
    "Implement coordinate validation checks during data submission to prevent large discrepancies",
    "Consider adding buffer zone analysis around coordinates to verify environmental context matches sample type"
