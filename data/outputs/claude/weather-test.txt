The weather at the Statue of Liberty on January 1st, 2025: cool with early morning rain (42-49Â°F), high humidity (90-98%), and decreasing wind speeds throughout the day.

I used the weather-context-mcp tool which retrieves data from Meteostat using the New York / Wall Street weather station (2.05 miles away).
