On January 1st, 2025, at the Statue of Liberty location:
- Temperatures ranged from 42°F to 49°F throughout the day
- Early morning rain with 0.41 total inches of precipitation from 1-5 AM
- High humidity (90-99%) in morning, clearing to 57% by evening
- Moderate winds from varying directions, strongest at 17.4 mph
- Low pressure system (999-1006 mb) with partly cloudy to cloudy conditions

I used the **weather-context-mcp** tool which retrieves historical weather data from the meteostat API using weather station "New York / Wall Street" (3.2 miles from the coordinates).
