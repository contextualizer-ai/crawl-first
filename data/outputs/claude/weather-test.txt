On January 1st, 2025, the weather at the Statue of Liberty was mild and rainy. Temperatures ranged from 42-49Â°F, with light rain (0.4 inches total) mostly in the early morning hours. High humidity (up to 99%) and westerly winds of 3-17 mph. The day cleared up by afternoon with partly cloudy skies.

I used the weather-context-mcp service, which retrieved data from the New York Wall Street weather station (about 2 miles away) using the Meteostat database.
