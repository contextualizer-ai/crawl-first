The land cover data shows this location (NYC coordinates) is classified as "Water Bodies" across all classification systems (IGBP, UMD, BGC, PFT, LCCS1-3) with ENVO term "water body". The QA layer indicates it was originally classified as snow/ice but corrected to water.

I used the `mcp__landuse-mcp__get_land_cover` tool.
