    study_description: "Understanding how the rhizosphere microbiome influences soil\
      \ nitrogen (N) transformations can inform management decisions that promote\
      \ bioenergy crop productivity under low-N conditions. Here, we coupled amplicon\
      \ sequencing with soil physiochemical and enzymatic parameters to understand\
      \ how rhizosphere microbial communities mediate N-transformations under low-\
      \ and high- N conditions. We collected rhizosphere soils from switchgrass (P.\
      \ virgatum), restored prairie, and undisturbed grassland across five locations\
      \ in the Great Lakes Region, two fertilization regimes, and three growing seasons\
      \ (2016- 2018)."
