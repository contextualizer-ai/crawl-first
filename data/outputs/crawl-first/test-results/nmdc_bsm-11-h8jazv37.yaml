    study_title: "The Impact of Stand Age and Fertilization on the Soil Microbiome\
      \ of Miscanthus \xD7 giganteus"
    study_description: "Yield of the perennial grass Miscanthus \xD7 giganteus has\
      \ shown an inconsistent and unpredictable response to nitrogen (N) fertilizer,\
      \ yet fertilization underpins the crop\u2019s environmental and economic sustainability.\
      \ The interactions among soil microbial communities, N availability, and Miscanthus\
      \ \xD7 giganteus and management may explain changes in plant productivity. In\
      \ this study, soil samples from different stand ages of Miscanthus \xD7 giganteus\
      \ in a replicated chronosequence field trial were used to investigate the effects\
      \ of stand age and N fertilizer rates on microbial community structure. We hypothesized\
      \ that there is a definable Miscanthus \xD7 giganteus soil microbiome and that\
      \ this community varies significantly with stand age and fertilization. Our\
      \ results showed that the main phyla in soil microbial communities, regardless\
      \ of plant age, are similar but microbial community structures are significantly\
      \ different. The variation in observed microbial communities generally decreases\
      \ with older stand ages. The amount of N fertilizer applied also affected the\
      \ microbial community structure associated with different aged Miscanthus \xD7\
      \ giganteus. Specifically, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria\
      \ and Gammaproteobacteria) and Acidobacteria (subgroup Gp1) increased shortly\
      \ after fertilization and was more associated with younger Miscanthus \xD7 giganteus.\
      \ Furthermore, our results show a significant relationship between bacterial\
      \ \u03B1 diversity and fertilization rates and that this response is also affected\
      \ by stand age. Overall, our results emphasize linkages between microbial community\
      \ structure, plant age, and fertilization in Miscanthus \xD7 giganteus."
