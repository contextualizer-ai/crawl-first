    study_title: "Creating the GROW (Genome Resolved Open Watershed) Database: Leveraging\
      \ Distributed Research Networks to Understand Watershed Systems"
    study_description: "Streams and rivers represent key functioning units in Earth\u2019\
      s terrestrial system that provide services essential for global energy, food\
      \ and water security, as well as human recreation. Rivers are responsible for\
      \ the transport and nutrient processing of terrestrial water and solutes across\
      \ landscapes with discharge into reservoirs, estuaries, and oceans. Despite\
      \ these important ecological roles, we know surprisingly little about the microbiomes\
      \ in river and stream systems. Here, we will address this knowledge gap by sampling\
      \ over 250 rivers, including the 35 larger rivers in the United States, many\
      \ of which will be collected over time or across interconnected hydrological\
      \ units, with a sub-set also receiving metatranscriptomes and metabolome data.\
      \ To accomplish this breadth and intensity of sampling, we have formed a collaborative\
      \ 15-member research consortium composed of hydrologists, geochemists, ecologists,\
      \ and microbiologists. The overarching objective is to genomically resolve the\
      \ taxonomy, the metabolic potential and expression, and distribution of riverine\
      \ microorganisms and traits within and across watersheds."
